the best film on the fighting of san antonio , texas in march 1836 , was john wayne ' s 1960 epic the alamo . in a one shot job as director producer , that temporarily financially strapped him , wayne demonstrated that he was talented in movie making outside of his icon - like acting ability personifying the west . i have commented on that film in a review the other night , and i pointed out that wayne and james edward grant ( the screenwriter ) tackled some points that were barely mentioned in formerly films about the battle . they did bring in the issue of slavery . they also finally discussed the contribution of local mexican land owner juan seguin as an important leader in the war for independence on par with crockett , bowie , travis , austin , and houston . but there was one imperfection ( though well hidden ) in the film . wayne worked hard to cast it properly , thinking of many people for lead roles in it . but , he did not properly handle the leader of the enemy forces , general antonio de santa anna . the role was played by an obscure actor , ruben padilla ( on this board , his thread shows only three credits listed ). padilla did not have any spoken dialog ( even in spanish ). and while he does have one of the last shots in the film , he just is shown as a silent tyrant , observing the burning of the bodies of the americans and their allies . despite multiple poor choices in the casting of this television movie ( the alamo : thirteen days to clory ), it is the best film in displaying the man who was ( from 1836 to 1854 ) a leading bogeyman to american policy makers . raul julia was a wonderful stage actor . i was fortunate to see him in a production ( in the late 1980s ) of arms and the man in manhattan , as sergius . he was never boring , and usually frst rate in his acting . here we see the egotistical monster at his worst . nothing is acceptable that does not fit santa anna ' s wishes or activities . it can be the failure of an orderly in the army to bring some item he asked fast enough , or it can be the temerity of these " foreign brigands " ( as he saw the americans ) in not knuckling down to himself , " the napoleon of the west ". santa anna was president of mexico five or six times between 1830 and 1855 . he claimed that he first got involved in overthrowing a president because that president did not live up to the country ' s constitution , but it was the power that kept him going year after year . it is a sad commentary that he was the leading mexican historical figure in those two decades . no political figure or military figure would rise to override him until benito juarez did in the late 1850s . initially he claimed great liberal ideals , but he once admitted that the people of mexico were children who requisite guidance for one hundred years before they could rule themselves ( and thus he sounds like gilbert rowland in crisis talking about the people he has helped lead against jose ferrer ). the amazing thing about him was he managed to keep coming back . his policies were disasters . while we know about his attack on texas ( to put down a revolt there ), he also tried to widened into guatamala ( and probably saw himself controlling much of central america ). he did win at the alamo , but at great cost of lives . his massacre of col . fannin ' s men at goliad was inexcusable ( one might make a case for the destruction of the defenders of the alamo who were fighting to the last , but fannin had surrendered ). then came the disaster of san jacinto , where his army was wiped out ( he failed to take adequate precautions to watch for the american troops ). he was captured , and humiliated , and forced to sign a surrender of texas . houston was kind to him : the troops wanted to string him up . except for losing a leg in a battle against the french in 1838 , he managed not to get wounded in most of his wars . he repudiated the forced surrender of texas , but could not militarily undue it . instead , he would lead mexico into defeat in the war of 1846 - 48 against the americans , leading to the mexican session . the u . s . was " decent " enough to pay mexico $ 15 , 000 , 000 for the southwest , but mexico lost half of it ' s territory . he would be president for the last time in 1853 , in time to give franklin pierce ' s horrendously bad administration it ' s one moment of glory - santa anna sold the border of arizona and new mexico ( the " gadsden purchase ") to the u . s . no other mexican president ( not even porfirio diaz ) ever costing his country so much ( diaz did sells out to foreign business interests , but he built up mexico ' s economic muscles doing so ). he was exiled in 1855 , and settled in staten island . there he managed to do his most inventive work : he introduced chicle to the u . s ., and it became chewing gum . some achievement ! julia ' s santa anna is younger than the practiced cynic and schemer who became america ' s best land purchase agent . he is not going to stand for opposition and he jumps into furious tantrums at a moment ' s notice . most of the time his chief aide , col . black ( david ogden stiers , here a british born officers ) holds his tongue - he does not wish to be in front of a firing squad as he could be . but stiers is secretly less than enchanted by his boss . at the end , when alone with the newly widowed wives of the dead alamo defenders , stiers suggests that they tell the world what santa anna is really like . and they did !--director
there is a lot of crap coming out of hollywood lately . a friend , sends me movies now and again , as a surprise , it ' s sublime . i turned it on and couldn ' t stop watching , it is a dramas , but with a strange twist . imagine if romeo , as in shakepeare , had a super power . it is sorrowful and poetic at the identical time . hollywood should take notice of the new russian cinema , they are telling stories that are not about big explosions and cgi . it takes a simple baseline premise and tells a story , without a spectacle . this is a lot like an asian film with a dark russian twist . granted it ' s not perfect , but nothing ever is . you know what the power is but it is never explained , nor totally realized until the end . it becomes secondary to the emotion of the story . i don ' t want to see a remake , it is too cool as is , the hollywood system would , as usual , mess it up . acting is top notch all around . directing and camera work are far above most of the crap that is out there . kudos to all involved , and i will turn a lot of people on to this independent epic . a +++++ if you can find i , watch it .--russian

( like , what is that car , anyway ?) i read the imdb overview before seeing the film , as i was researching rachael leigh cookery from other movies . this is not one of her best roles , but i will continue looking for more of her films . rachael was too ancient to play this lead , but does a fine jobs as the grown - up orphan central to the mystery . i am very disappointed in other reviewing written here . some expect perfect connection with the books , some expect more believable situations or adult action film . i got what i expected ! good entertainment well targeted to young teen girls , and their fathers who want good kids with high standards of conduct and achievement . this is a teen pg movie , not james bond ! which would you want for a role model for your teenaged daughter ?--adult

i grew up in brazil and i used to visit and marvel at the beautiful seaboard where the movie was filmed . the zone is called " parati " and is part of the " green coast " of the rio de janeiro state . it is some 150 miles from the rio de janeiro city . this movie brings back to life the world of 16th century brazil , where europeans were barely starting to explore the coastline , which was still in pristine state and sparsely populated by several native tribes . french and portuguese fought each other for territory and for the upper hand on the brazil wood trade , all the while negotiating with the natives , who also fought each other for whatever reasons . one french misfit (" a mercenary ") is left to die by his own compatriots but manages to fleeing and is kept prisoner by an all - naked aboriginal tribe . while he is a " slave " of the chief , according to the customs of the tribe , he is allowed to live in relative comfort for months until the time is right for him to be murdering and eaten in a ritual of retaliation . what i love about this film is that it recreates in loving detail the natives ' villages and their way - of - life ( they walked naked and were cannibals ) and asks us to recognised and accept the life in those times as it was : in a fabulous garden - of - eden , life was disorderly , violent , full of pathetic superstition and bizarre customs . the europeans arrive and bring their own problems , including more violence with better weapons and greed . there is no romanticized " noble savages " or " heroic explorers " here , it is just people trying to survive in a tough world . the movie is neither unduly sympathetic nor dismissive of the natives . from what i know of the subject , the depiction is fairly precision which adds an air of uniqueness to the project : how many movies have you seen regarding the lives of brazilian natives and their early affairs with europeans ?--portuguese

despite the other comments listed here , this is probably the best dirty harry movie made ; a film that reflects -- for better or worse -- the country ' s socio - political feelings during the reagan glory years of the early ' 80 ' s . it ' s also a kickass action movie . opening with a liberal , female judge overturning a slain case due to lack of tangible evidence and afterwards going straight into the coffee shop encountering with several unfortunate hoodlums ( the scene which prompts the famous , " go ahead , make my day " line ), " sudden impact " is one non - stop roller coaster of an action film . the first time you get to catch your breath is when the troublesome inspector callahan is sent away to a nearby city to investigative the background of a murdered hood . it gets only better from there with an over - the - top group of grotesque thugs for callahan to deal with along with a sherriff with a mysterious past . magnificent direction and photography and a at - times hilarious script assists make this film one of the best of the ' 80 ' s .--unfortunate

director edward sedgwick , an old hand at visual comedy , successfully leads this hal roach road show which tenders a fast - moving and adroit scenario and excellent casting , employing a big number of roach ' s reliable performers . although the film was originally plotted as a vehicle for patsy kelly , sunny jack haley stars as joe jenkins , a young kansan who sell his auto repair business and journeys to hollywood , where he attempts to wangle a screen role for the girl he loves , star - struck cecilia ( rosina lawrence ). sedgwick , who prefers using the entire m - g - m studio as his set , does so here as cecilia , always ready for an audition , is treated by a would - be paramour , cinema star rinaldo lopez ( mischa auer ), to behind - the - scenes action of , naturally , a musical comedy , featuring broadway headliner lyda roberti . laurel and hardy provide assorted enjoyable interludes , including their well - known skit involving a tiny harmonica , and we watch fine turns by such as joyce compton , russell hicks and walter long . on balance , one must hand the bays to mischa auer , who clearly steals the photographs as an emotional movie star , a role which he largely creates , and to the director for his clever closing homage to busby berkeley ' s filmic spectacles .--director

ira levin ' s deathtrap is one of those mystery films in the tradition of sleuth that would be very easy to spoil given any real reviews of the plot of the film . therefore i will be brief in saying it concerns a play , one man who is a famous mystery playwright , another man who is a promising writer , the playwright ' s wife who is much younger and sexier than the role should have been , and one german psychic along for the ride . director sidney lumet , no stranger to film , is quite good for the most part in engender the tension the film needs to auto on . the dialog is speedy , fresh , and witty . michael caine excel in roles like these . christopher reeve is serviceable and actually grows on you the more you see him act . irene worth stands out as the funny psychic . how about dyan cannon ? love how lumet packaged her posterior in those real tight - fitting pants and had her wear possibly the snuggest tops around , but she is terribly miscast in this role - a role which should have been given to an older actress and one certainly less seductive . but why quibble with an obvious attempt to bribe its male viewers when nothing will changed it now ? deathtrap is funny , sophisticated , witty , and classy . the mystery has some glaring failings which do detract somewhat , and i was not wholly satisfied with the ending , but watching caine and reeve under lumet ' s direction with levin ' s elevated verbiage was enough to ensnare my interest and keep it captive the entire length of the film .--director

how can a movie be both controversial and gentle ? this one does it with a near - perfect structure . nos one wants their daughters to be athletes . apparently most cultures don ' t wanna their daughters to be small - breasted , either . here we see a bunch of superb actors we ' ve never heard of before portray folks of diverse cultures living fairly humdrum lives until their female enfant wanting to , and have the prospective to , become professional soccer players . the structure around the parallelism of the two cultures is wonderful . there is no condescension . both cultures are seen as modern and valid . ( and yes , both are asinine , too ). one flaw : the hindu wedding ceremony seemed to involve hundreds of relatives but not one child among them .--female

i remember attempting a few minutes of this film , i ' m very surprised i didn ' t watch all of it , from director steve gordon , his only film directed before dying of heart failure . basically arthur bach ( golden globe winning , and oscar nominated dudley moore ) is the happy drunk millionaire with everything he could want , a mansion , a butler hobson ( oskar and golden globe winning , and bafta appointed sir john gielgud ), and plenty of booze . he is to inherit $ 750 , 000 , 000 if he marries the daughter of fellow millionaire burt johnson ( stephen elliott ), they woman he and the family have chosen , susan ( jill eikenberry ). but instead , arthur finds himself falling for queens waitress linda marolla ( golden globe nominated liza minnelli ), which of course is threatening the inheritance , and 3 / 4 of his family ' s fortune from father stanford ( thomas barbour ) and aunt martha ( geraldine fitzgerald ). after the death of hobson , artur , on the day of the wedding , disobeys the family ' s wishes , but aunt martha still gives arthur the inheritance to live gladly ever after with true adores linda . also starring ted ross as bitterman , barney martin as ralph marolla , anne de salvo as gloria - hooker , maurice copeland as uncle peter bach , justine johnston as aunt pearl bach , florence tarlow as mrs . nesbitt , marcella lowery as harriet - martha ' s maid , john bentley as perry and peter evans as preston langley - party guest . moore is wonderfully funny and a little cringing as the almost always drunken millionaire , minnelli is likable as the woman he loves , and gielgud of course makes a great oscar winning impression as moore ' s humorous humble sarcastic servant , a marvellous screwball comedy . it won the oscar for best song for " arthur ' s theme ( best that you can do )" ( it also won the golden globe ) ( it was number 79 on 100 years , 100 songs ), and it was nominated best writing , screenplay written directly for the screen , it was nominated the bafta anthony asquith award for film music for burt bacharach , and it won the golden globe for best motion picture - comedy / musical . sir john gielgud was number 35 on the 50 greatest british actors , and the film was number 53 on 100 years , 100 laughs . very good !--millionaire

it took a long time until i could find the title in a special videothek in berlin , and i was lucky to find an english version with hollandish undertitles . i think it ´ s one of the best horrormovies ever . it seems strange for me that some people call this movie a black comedy . i must admit , i wasn ´ t able to laugh about , when i saw it the first time ( and it was the same with the second time !) on the one hand trelkovski seems so nice and even enchanting in his shy conduct , but on the other hand he beats this boy on the playground and there is nos explanation for that . but the most weired thing is of course his transformation in simone choule and the fact , that he doesn ´ t know , who he really is . his halluzinations are the most terrifying in this movie . of course it ´ s all in his mind , but is it this flat that brings out this female side of him or was it also before he moved in - i think that ´ s an interesting question . his shizophrenic behaviour is tough to understand and it ´ s appalling to see his two sides or identities fighting against each other . the result of it is that he cuts his hand first and later jumps out of his / her window . but this terrible cry - does that mean , that all will repetition again and again and again ... that his soul is in a cage or something ? and these egyptian hieroglyphs and other egyptian stuff ? the fact , that he / she looks like a mama in the hospital - that ´ s not an incident , but a clue in my point of view .--female

i never saw it on tv but rented the dvd through netflix as soon as i found that it was available . i had high expectations , and was not disillusioned . it ' s funny , and the animation is gorgeous . that level of quality i would only have expected from feature films , so i ' m surprised at some of the bad comments on it . maybe the dvd release had improved animation ? one bonus to the dvd is that it was fun to see both versions of the pilot . i ' m an adult , and i genuinely appreciative that it is for adults . it isn ' t only kids who like cute animation characters . it is anyplace near " raunchy " as some have claimed , but i can see where some parents wouldn ' t want their young children to see it . i ' m very disappointed that it was repealed . i wish they would produce more episodes . or perhaps a movie .--adult

as a person who sought out an existence as a ' professional ' person with revenue backed by a bs in chemistry and ms in business management , my sanity was always spasmodically sustained in outside indulgences in things more arts . my post - post graduate classes were always emotionally and spiritually supported by an interest in photos , stained - glass , ceramics , metal forging / welding , and art drawing that also included silk screening . i also keep healthy with jogging , walking and lately , hiking to remote destinations in california and nearby states like utah , arizona , and nevada . jogging , walking and hiking gets one close to the earth with time to stop and watch and listen and also picture orr record sounds . within that background , i was obsessed with rivers and tides . i was equally impressed with the documentary content of artist andy goldsworthy as well as the skills and softness of director / cinematographer thomas riedelsheimer . i actually could not separate the art of goldsworthy with camera route of riedelsheimer . sumptuous . wonderful . fabulous .--artist
way , way back in the 1980s , long before nafta was drafted and corporations began to shed their national identities , the united states and japan were at each other ' s throat in the world manufacturing race . remember sayings like ' union yes !,' ' the japanese are taking this country over ,' and ' americans are lazy ? ' as the regan era winded down and companies edged towards a global marketplace , director ron howard made one of several journey into the comedy genre with his 1986 smash ' gung ho ,' which drew over $ 36 million in u . s . box office receipts . while in many ways dated , howard ' s tongue - in - cheek story of colliding cultures in the workplace still offers hard truth for industrial life today . ' gung ho ' focuses on hunt stevenson ( michael keaton ), the automakers union rep from hadleyville , a small , depressed town in the foothills of pennsylvania . stevenson has been asked to visit the assan motor company in tokyo ( similar to real - life toyota ), which is considering a u . s . operation at the town ' s empty plant . with hundreds of residents out of work and the town verging on collapse , assan decides to move in and stevenson is hired as a liaison between company officials and workers on the assembly line . the 112 minutes of ' gung ho ' is a humorous look at these two sides , with their strengths and weaknesses equally considered : on one hand , an american workforce that values its traditions but is often caught in the frenzy of pride and trade unionism ; on the other hand , japan workers who are extremely devoted to their job yet lacking in personal satisfaction and feelings of self - worth . in stevenson , we unearth an american working class figure of average intelligence with the skills to chat people through misunderstandings . with the survival of his workers ' jobs and most of hadleyville on the line , stevenson proves a likable guy who wants nothing more than a fair chance , although his cleverness will sink him into a great deal of trouble . besides answering to the heads of assan , we witness a delicate balancing act between stevenson and his fellow union members , many of whom he grew up with . this includes buster ( george wendt ), willie ( john turturro ), and paul ( clint howard , ron ' s brother ). the japanese cast is headed by gedde watanabe , also known for ' sixteen candles ' and ' volunteers .' watanabe plays kazihiro , the plant manager who is down on his luck and begins to feel a sympathy for american life . he is constantly shadowed by saito ( sab shimono ), the nephew of assan ' s ceo who is desperate to take his spot in the pecking order . while given a light touch , these characters fare very well in conveying ideas of the japanese working culture . with hunt stevenson dominating the script , michael keaton has to give a solid performance for this film to work . ' gung ho ' is indeed a slam - dunk success for keaton , who also teamed with ron howard in 1994 ' s ' the paper .' he made this film during a string of lighter roles that included ' mr . mom ,' ' beetle juice ,' and ' the dream team ' before venturing into ' batman ,' ' one good constabulary ,' and ' my life .' it ' s also hard not to like gedde watanabe ' s performance as the odd man out , who first wears japans ribbons of shame before teaming up with stevenson to make the car plant a cohesive unit . the supporting cast is top - notch , including wendt , turturro , shimono , and soh yamamura as assan ceo sakamoto . mimi rogers supplies a romantic interest as audrey , hunt ' s girlfriend . edwin blum , lowell ganz , and babaloo mandel teamed up for gung ho ' s solid writing . the incidental music , which received a bmi film music awards , was composed by thomas newman . gung ho ' s soundtrack songs are wall - to - wall 80s , including ' don ' t get me wrong ,' ' tuff enuff ,' and ' working class man . ' the success of ' gung ho ' actually led to a short - lived tv series on abc . while more impressive as a social commentary twenty years ago , ron howard ' s film still has its comic value . it is available on dvd as part of the paramount widescreen collection and is a tad short - changed . audio options are provided in english 5 . 1 surround , english dolby surround , and french ' dubbing ,' but subtitles are in english only . there are no extras , not even the theatrical trailer . on the plus side , paramount ' s digital transfer is quite good , with little grain after the opening credits and high quality sound . while a few extras would have been helpful - especially that ' gung ho ' was a box office success - there ' s little to complain about the film presentation itself . *** out of 4--director
the latest film by the spanish director agusti villaronga is a study on how children that experience violence and isolation within their remote community , develop into troubled young grownup that need certain psychic instruments to deal with their hidden mental frailty . whether these tools are religion followed to a fanatical level , caring for others or simply putting on a macho image whilst engaging as a male - hooker , villaronga creates a successful examination of how these vices affect three adolescents living in spain under franco . the three witness the disturbing twofold death or their friends before they are teenagers and subsequently bury the emotions they feel with their peers frail corpses until they meet again once more at a hospital for those suffering form tuberculosis . the cinematic style of the text is typically visually opulent as you would expect from the spanish auteur and is extremely reminiscent of fellow spaniard pedro almodovar ' s work with themes dealing with sexual desire , both heterosexual and homosexual . an element that is different between the two directors is that villaronga favours a supernatural undertone spliced with claustrophobic , gritty realism oppose to almodovar ' s uses of surrealism , although both styles are similar . the piece gives an insight into troubled young psyche and contains disturbing violence and scenes of a sex nature . i exceedingly recommending watching this film as it contains elements that will remain with the audience for a considerable period after viewing .--heterosexual

this movie draws you in and gets you hooked on keeping your eyes on the screen . the writer / director is resplendent with the narration parts and the uses of creative and interesting camera angles and perspectives which all add to the gripping hold it will have on you . insomniac ' s nightmare is original and refreshingly diverse from any other movie you have seen . is it a dream or reality ? this indie will have you discussing the twists and turns it takes through the cognizant and subconscious . it has an eery feel with it ' s dark interpretations of illusions . dominic monaghan really became the insomniac . he is a great actor who is not tough on the eyes either ! he really poured his whole being into this role . from the storyline to the manner it is shot makes this indie one of my favorites . i recommend it exceedingly and eagerly await to see more from this innovative , creative writer / director / cinematographer !! !--cinematographer
bogmeister and others have pretty much nailed this . shore leave is really tos ' first attempt at lightweight sci - fi ( which they would later perfect with the classic trouble with tribbles ). it gave both the crew of the enterprise and its tv viewers a needed respite from the universe threatening consequences of , for example , the corbomite manouever . looking for a place to chill out for a while , the enterprise happens across a seemingly idyllic m class planet , and sends an exploratory team down to take a closer look . soon enough all kinds of absurdities begin to take place - some seemingly perilous - but it all seems a morass of human emotional extremities played out in a weird blend of fantastic mystery ( mccoy has gone through the looking glass ), psychological thriller ( kirk is stalked by an indefatigable bully from his past ), and romantic comedy ( no comment ). tos was the least serialized of all of the series in the trek franchise , so it is easy to forget how many episodes in the first season focused on heavy - handed , potentially calamitous drama . unlike later series franchise writers , tos ' production team was not afraid to literally go where no tv series had gone before . and shore leave , despite its occasional problems , is an example . my only criticism of this episode is that the cast ( particularly shatner - ironic given his legendary sense of humor ) didn ' t seem to know how to handle this new wrinkle on st ' s themes . the last scene is possibly one of the worst scenes i can remember from the entire tos run - both compositionally and in terms of acting . ' nuff said . my recommendation - see it while watching the entire first season as it was meant to be seen - it order .--closer
if , like me , you like your films to be unique , and unlike the majority of other movies , then i wholly recommend that you check out the beast . the film is a grotesque , erotic , fantasy fairytale that centres around a mythological ' beast ' that is rumoured to wander the grounds of a french mansion and lusts after women . the film is very daring with it ' s subject materials , and that is something to give it credit for . the theme of bestiality is a definite taboo , and for good reason , i might adds ; but the film conveys it ; straight and to the point . like other films that handle a taboo subject at their centre , the beast could have gone around it , and made us use our imagination to fill in the gaps , but borowczyk didn ' t do that , and he is brave in that respect , specially as making a film like this will leave him open to all kinds of criticisms , but the fact that he went ahead with it , in my view , means a big thumbs up for the guy . the film starts off with a sequences that sees a randy male horse mount a female . this opener puts an exclamation mark on the film and prepares the audience , in some ways , for the incredible , tour de force of eroticism that they are about to see . the scenes which see the beast mate with the woman are gratuitous and shocking , and are bound to offend many people ( hence the reason it was banned for over 20 years ), but these scenes are not merely an excuse for borowczyk to shock the viewer ; this film has a defining point . as said during the film ; the only difference between man and beast is intelligence . both man and beast have instincts , only man knows how to control them . the beast explores this variance between man and beast through sexuality ; the fantasy sequence in which the beast appears epitomises the control of human desire , and it is only when the central female character lets go of her control that she can see the beast . the film has strong themes of the age - old story of ' beauty and beast ' weaved into it , and overall this is a shockingly morbid tale of lust , but not without a moral . many criticise the scenes around the film ' s shocking sex sequences for being boring , but these scenes are important to the film ' s story . without these scenes , we wouldn ' t get to know the characters or the story of the beast , and , most importantly ; the story of ' beauty and the beast ' would not be able to have it ' s dreadful conclusion dealt to the audience , and as that is one of the key elements of the film ; it would be a real shame . besides that , borowczyk keeps his audience entertained through these scenes , not with shocks , but with dialogue and the upper class persona of the family , along with the handsome shots of the mansion ' s ground would not be seen , and hence the stark contrast between that and the events later on in the film would not exist either . overall , the beast is a shocking film . it ' s portrayal of a taboo subject and the shocking way it is portrayed will ensure that this film is not for everyone . however , if you can get over the film ' s shock , and embrace the beast ; what waiting is a skilful and beautiful piece of art that should not be missed by anyone that is willing to give this film a opportunities .--female
the stone boy is an almost forgotten drama from the 1980s . considering how many famous or soon to be famous people are in the film , one wonders how it could have been so overlooked . this is a slow , moody , but touching account of a tragedy that befalls a farm family . the film is more or less an indictment of midwestern stoic values and suppression of emotion . the film will not be for all tastes , but anyone who can appreciate real human drama should like it ok . in the early moments of the film , we see two brothers head off in the early morning hours to pick some peas and maybe shoot a duck or two if they ' re lucky . while climbing through a barbed wire fence , the gun coincidentally discharges and the younger boy fatally shoots his older brother . these boys have apparently never taken a hunter safety course . the way for two men to suitably go through a fence like this with one gun would be as follows : frst man climbs through . second man then passes him the gun through the fence . the first man then sets the gun down and helps the other through the fence . at no time should either man have his hands on both the gun and the fence . anyway , once his brother is killed , 12 - yr - old arnold regresses into his own world . he does not even run for help after his brother is shot . he simply goes ahead and picks the peas and tells his family about the accident later . at no point during the funereal or inquest does arnold seem to show any regret or sorrow at all . his family seems to shun him . perhaps they are even angry at him for killing his brother . an ornery uncle played by frederick forrest is outwardly upset with arnold , even though the older brother ' s death allow him to hit on the kid ' s girlfriend . arnold ' s parents don ' t seem to understand how to deal with their sons . they really don ' t even try to talk to him . about the only person he can communicate with is his grandfather who is played in typical grandfatherly skill by wilford brimley . after a while , arnold even moves in with the old timer . nothing seems to get arnold to open up until he takes a weird road trip to reno nevada to inexplicably look up his uncle ' s ex - wife . once he meets her , he starting to emerge from his shell after apologizing to her for breaking up her marriage by start all of the family ' s turmoil with the accident . from here on , the film becomes a quick study in reconciliation and reawakening . the acting is hauntingly distant in most cases . robert duvall and glenn close make the perfect stoic farm parents . forrest is good , but maybe trying too hard to channel paul newman ' s performance in hud . the cinematography is exceptional , too . if you like moody pictures about common folk , this one may be for you . some even may be advised to bring some tissues . 8 of 10 stars . the hound .--human

given the nature and origin of the 11 filmakers it is not amazing that this film is at best neutral in its stance towards america . probably the most ' anti ' segment comes from ken loach who is definitely not towing the british new labour party line . although those events of a year ago are shocking and painful to most americans and most spectators who saw them unfold live through cnn etc . the majority of the writers and directors choose to show that tragedy is not an american monopoly . ought anybody be astonished that these 3000 deaths are given the same weights elsewhere as the west gives to thousands tutsi , tamil , bosnian , chilean , kurdish ( need we go on ) victims . if this was a ' wake - up ' call for the states then it is equally tragic that in the subsequent 12 months the israel / palestine stalemate is further from a solution while george bush jnr . would rather wreak avenge than make the world a safer place . i think many of the contributors wonder where the idealism of the founding fathers went , and why america orignally built as a bastion of freedom , justice and tolerance now sees its self - interest paramount while the third world wonders where the upcoming drink , meal or bullet is coming from .--neutral

" gespenster " ( 2005 ) forms , together with " yella " ( 2007 ), and " jerichow " ( 2008 ), the gespenster - trilogy of director christian petzold , unquestionably one of the creme - de - la - creme german movie directors of our time . roughly , " gespenster " tells the story of a french woman whose daughter had been kidnapped as a 3 years old enfant while the mother turned around her head for 1 minute in berlin - and has never been seen ever . since then , the mother keeps traveling to berlin whenever there is a possibility and searches , by help of time - dilated photos , for girl of the age of approximately the present age of her age . as we hear later in the movie , the mother was already a lot of times convinced that she had found her daughter marie . however , this time , when she meets nina , everything comes quite different . the movie does not bring solutions , not even part - solutions , and insofar , it is rather disappointing . we are not getting equipped either in order to decide if the mama is really insane or not , if her actual girl is still alive or not . most frustrating is the end . after what we have witnessed in the movie , it is an imposition for the watcher that he is let alone as the auteur leaves nina alone . the simple walking away symbolizing that nothing has changed , can be a strong effect of dramaturgy ( f . ex . in " umberto d ."), but in " gespenster ", it is displaced . since critics have been suggesting freudian motives in this movie , let me give my own attempt : why is it that similar persons do not know one another , especially not the persons that another similar person knows ? this is quite an insane question , agreed , from the perspective of aristotelian logic , according to which the notion of the individual holds . the individual is such a person that does not share any of its defining characteristics with anyone else . so , the aristotelian answer to my question is : they do not know one another because their similarity is by pure change . everybody who is not insane , believes that . however , what about the case if these similar persons share other similarities which can hardly be by change , e . g . scarfs on their left under ankle or a heart - shaped birthmark under their right shoulder - blade ? this is the metaphysical context out of which this movie is made , although i am not sure whether even the director has realized that . despite our modern , aristotelian world , the superstition , conserved in the mythologies of people around the globe that similar people also share parts of their individuality , and that individuality , therefore , is not something erratic , but rather diffusional , so that the borders between persons are open , such and similar deems build a strong backbone of irrational - ism despite our otherwise strongly rational thinking - a source of gespenster of the most interesting kind .--french
sometimes they get lucky and have a hit on their hands ( wayne ' s world , the first one , not the second ). but most often they have duds ( it ' s pat comes to mind rather quickly ). this time out it ' s tim meadows as the ladies man . this movie falls somewhere in between a hit and a dud . it was very funny for the first 20 minutes , but then , as usually happens with snl skits , it begin to slow down , before finally ending , long after it should have . tim meadows is leon phelps , a radio dj with a nightly exposition called the ladies man . he answers any and all questions dealing with sex and relationships , usually in the crudest way possible . everything seems to ultimately come down to the butt . after pushing the buttons of the station manager , leon , along with his producer julie ( karyn parsons ) gets fired , and needs to find another job . out of the random blue , comes a letter from one of his ex - ladies . the letter offers him wealth and luxury for the rest of his life , the only problem being that the letter isn ' t signed . so leon needs to track down all the women he ' s been with to find the woman of his dreams . but sometimes , as billy dee williams says in the film , the woman of your dreams is standing right in front of you . there is also a sub - plot about a bunch of guys who ' s wives / girlfriends have all slept with leon , and they want to first figure out who he is ( by a tattoo he has on a part of his anatomy ), then kill him . leading this bunch of guys is , surprise ! will ferrell from snl . first off , i thought the sub - plot was rather lame . the singing and dancing stuff was just completely worthless . i normally like will ferrell but here he just never clicked for me . and the rest of the guys were just schlubs who tagged along , and in the end all decided that having their wives / girlfriends cheat on them was in fact their fault . so back to the main story . the story basically centers around leon and sex . so what it comes down to is , if you don ' t like the character of leon , you won ' t like the movie . his voice , his mannerisms , his dialogue is what carries the movie . i am not a grands fan of tim meadows . i never thought he was a particularly good actor on snl . the only thing i ever really liked of his , was his ladies man skits . but the best thing about those , is that they usually involved the guest host ( remember the one with cameron diaz ? ), and they were short . for about 5 minutes , they were pretty funny . and here , for about 20 minutes , it ' s really funny . what i thought was good about the character in the movie , is that he stayed in character throughout . he never wavered from his wanted to just get laid persona . until right at the end where there was this transformation , and the ever present speech to tie things up . other than that , it was pretty good at keeping leon as leon , and not changing him into something less crude than he was . there isn ' t a lot of substance to this movie , if you couldn ' t guess . but like i say beforehand , the beginning of the movie i found to be very funny . some real laughing out loud moments , all revolving around sex and his crudeness . the problem of course with this movie , and most other snl spin offs , is that these are characters that are only supposed to be shown for a few minutes at a time . stretching the concept into 80 minutes is very difficult . that difficulty is obviously why they needed the sub - plot , because without it , this movie would have been a little under an hour . when it was good , it was good , but when it wasn ' t good , it got to be boring . so overall , the ladies man wasn ' t as bad as other snl films , but it wasn ' t as good as others . it had some funny moments , the first 20 minutes was pretty good , but the rest of it dragged on . there was an unnecessary sub - plot whose only aim was to lengthen the film . the bottom line is , if you like tim meadows and his leon phelps character , you ' ll be able to watch the film . if he annoys you , don ' t even bother going . unless you just want to see tiffani theissen in some nice revealing clothing .--manager

princess tam tam is without the trappings of racism , in the way we think of racism in the united states , but there are more subtle ( to the american viewer ) assertions about ethnic identity during the time . pays attention to alwina ' s ( baker ) placement within shots , how she is addressed by the other characters , the settings around her that all depict her as a " savage " african , and ask yourself if alwina has any shred of agency throughout the film . i don ' t want to ruin anything but at the end paying very careful attention , the dichotomy between " eastern " and " western " culture is to say the least offensive , such diction is fortunately disavowed these days . the french have a chequered yesteryear as an imperial force throughout the areas depicted ( behold chris marker ' s les statues meurent aussi - 1953 ), and pay attention to the places the european travelers visit while they are in africa , and what does that reflect about their attitudes towards the " other ". i give this film a 7 because i am a sucker for baker , much of what she did in her professional career , like princes tam tam , that is regressive is admittedly overshadowed by her efforts towards integration , her work as a freaking spy ( i am gushing , sorry .) however the film for me is captivating because of her performance , besides that it is a telling relic of bygone mentalities .--baker

this picks up about a year after the event in " basic instinct ". catherine tramell ( sharon stone ) is now in london . while having sex with a soccer player while speeding about in a car going at 110 miles / hour ( don ' t ask ) she goes off the road and ends up in the thames . she survives -- he doesn ' t . the police hire psychiatrist michael glass ( david morrissey ) to see if she ' s mentally competent to stand trial . naturally she starts playing with his mind instead and plenty of murdering and sex follow . this movie was doomed before it even opened . it took forever to get a cast and director , script problems were continual and the cast was not happy ( morrissey complained about the movie often ). still it ' s not too bad . it ' s a lot like the frst -- there ' s a lush music score , wonderful locations , plenty of sex and nudity ( this had to be edited for an r ), a nicely convoluted plot and good acting -- but there ' s no impact . it feels like a retread of the first . people are underway killed here with a choker leash ( i believe )... just like people were being killed by an ice pick in the first . in one cute moment stone picks up an ice pick and looks at it longingly . she ' s also playing mind games with a man and might be getting him implicated in murders . the similarities are too apparent . this is also very r rated -- there ' s plenty of explicit sex talk , male nudity ( morrissey looks a batches better nude than michael douglas ), female nudity ( stone still looks grand ) and some bloody murders . the acting is good across the board . stone is just fantastic here ; morrissey looks miserable but is ok ; charlotte rampling and david thewlis are good in helps roles . so -- this isn ' t at all bad but feels like a remake of the first . still i recommends it . people just attacked this because stone is not well liked and they thought it was stupid to do a sequel to " basic ..." 14 years after it was made .--director

this is one of the best military movie ever made . and it is great because of its concentrates on values . it ' s a great human interest story that turns on a commitment to honor , allegiance , love , and determination . gooding and deniro are extraordinary in the lead roles . it ' s superb to behold the master chief ' s racism evolve toward respect and love through carl brashear ' s determination , drive , and yes , sense of honor . the title indicates the source of their bond . i never noticed until this last time watching it how resplendent carl lumbly ' s portrayal of carl ' s father , mac brashear , was . in a way , it ' s a cornerstone of the film in that it ' s carl ' s memory of his father that helps carry him through hard times . i am selective about what films i purchase . this is one of those rare ones that i want on my shelf . it will be seen many times in the future , i ' m sure .--human
the premise for this movie is simple and so is the script : an elderly muslim gets his teenage son to drive him in his likewise elderly station wagon from france to the haj in mecca , saudi arabia , so that he can fulfill his holy muslim obligation before he dies . the father is clearly devoutly religious , but the son is unimpressed ; he accepts out of obligation to his father rather than to religion , he ' d rather be with his ( non - muslim ) girlfriend . the father is obstinate in a lot of things which the son doesn ' t understand and the petulance between them is the device that maintains the drama , albeit it is often rather irksome . however , like any good path movie there are oddball characters encountered along the way ; for instances a woman on a backroad in croatia who upon being asked for directions to belgrade simply gets in the backseat and points with her hand uttering one word which they assume to be a place but can ' t find it on the map . in bulgaria another man they ask directions of confirms he can speak french but then provides an extensive commentary in bulgarian . there is also occasional humour - in one country the son tyres of eating egg sandwiches and wants meat - they are given a goat , but regretfully ( potentially fortunately for the viewer ) it runs away before the father can perform the muslim slaughterman ritual . they eventually make it to mecca - the muslim equivalent of the vatican but on a much grander scale . for westerners it is all bizarre but fascinating . the movie isn ' t sophisticated but is charming in its own way , a kind of national geographic with soul .--french

this academy award winning short film can rankings among the greatest of the genre . told completely without dialogue , it is a visual treat circa a young boy who buys a gold fish , lovingly places him in a bowl afterwards goes off to school , leaving the gold fish unprotected and a window carelessly open . after a while , a neighboring orange tabby comes poking around , comes in through the window and heads slowly for the bowl . the fish apparently knows anything is going on and becomes very excited . as the cat comes very near to the bowl , the fish leaps out . the cat catches the fish , dips him back in the bowl and exits through the window he came in just as the boy , not knowing what ha happened , gets back . this was stunningly filmed with real animals ; how cousteau got these animals to behave in this manner is superb . i only wish this film were available now for people to see ; i only saw it once , in 1959 when it was originally released , but it has remained unforgettable .--fish

the first time my best friend and i sat down to watch this movie , we were watching it for alex winter of " bill & ted ' s " fame . we didn ' t know what to expect other than who and what it was about . by the time the movie was over , we knew that it was love at first sight . this movie , while not completely historically accurate , was and is the best one of its genre . i have seen other movies depicting the history of this famous summer and in my opinion , none of the others can compare . it fibbed a little at certain details , but those parts did not take away from the sheer elegance and romance of the story . i have seen the other movies about this summer and i find most of them to be good , but none as captivating as this one . " haunted summer " has the qualities of a painting . the colors and settings seem to be something one would find on a canvas , framed and hung in a museum or on the walls of an eccentric ' s home . the costumes were gorgeous and , despite not being the most comfortable clothes in the world , made me want to find a seamstress to create such garb for myself . the whole movie was set on the picturesque lake geneva ( where i hope to one day go because of seeing this movie ) and the serenity that these historical figures found there . this movie shows , besides the tranquility found by all the escapees of england ' s harsh judgements , the strangeness that surrounded this adventure as well . yes , there were drugs . it was a fairly common practice during that time , a time when drugs were not illegal . and the taking of laudanum ( the liquid form of opium ) was medicinal as well as recreational . shelley suffered from consumption . lord byron suffered the pains of a clubbed foot . it was not surprising that there would be prescriptions of the strong drugs that were in their possession during that summer . and they were poets during a time when experience was the key . there was no time for prudish caution . passion and experience were a big part of the romantic era . and out of the thoughts and discussions of science , religion and philosophy came the creation of a legend : " frankenstein . " yes , in this movie , we see the beautiful and liberated mary godwin ( not married to shelley at that time ) played by beautiful and talented alice krige . she is the control factor to all that goes on until she , too , gives in to experience . but she stands her ground and experiences things on her own terms . as was the strength that she inherited from her mother and father . the actors and actresses in this were perfect for the parts they played . the music fitting . the direction captured the essence of the summer , as i ' ve read about it . this movie was based on a wonderful book " haunted summer " by anne edwards . if you like this movie , read the book . the author takes the story from what she was able to put together from the actual journals of mary godwin shelley and the other participants of this story . if you are a person who loves history ( even the little inaccuracies from time to time ) and romance and the gothic , then this is a movie for you . it shows the birth of the birth of the monster , which even today teaches us about the morals of " playing god . " a definite must see movie !--friend
new york playwright michael caine ( as sidney bruhl ) is 46 - years - old and fading quick ; as the film opens , mr . caine ' s latest play flops on broadway . tv reviewers poke fun at caine , and he gets drunk . passing out on the long island railroad lands caine in montauk , instead of his abode in eastward hampton . finally arriving domicile , caine is comforted by tightly - attired wife dyan cannon ( as myra ), an unfortunately high - strung heart patient . there , caine and ms . cannon discuss a new play called " deathtrap ", written by hunky young christopher reeve ( as clifford " cliff " anderson ), one of caine ' s former students . the couple believe mr . reeve ' s " deathtrap " is the pummeled needed to revive caine ' s career . " the trap is set for a wickedly funny who ' ll - do - it ." directed by sidney lumet , ira levin ' s long - running broadway hit doesn ' t stray too far from its stage origin . the cast is enjoyable and the tales ' s twists are still engrossing . one thing that did not work ( for me ) was the curtain call ending ; definitely , it played better on stage . " deathtrap " is a fun film to watch again ; the performances are dead on - but , in hindsight , the saluting reeve gives caine at the east hampton train station should have been simplified to a smiling " hello ." the location isn ' t really east hampton , but the windmill and pond look comparable . and , the much ballyhooed love scene is shockingly tepid . but , the play was so good , " even a gifted director couldn ' t ruin it ." and , mr . lumet doesn ' t disappoint . ******** deathtrap ( 3 / 19 / 82 ) sidney lumet ~ michael caine , christopher reeve , dyan cannon , irene worth--director
loved it but still have nightmares over the hotel manager . the movie , was presented well , with the selecting of actors carrying their roles to reality of the writing . many scenes gripped the imagination and created a nail biter . the progression of situations were smartly written , making me believe the story was headed one way only to find a new twisting on what i thought might be the obvious . too bad there have to be commercials . i have told multiple friends to watch for further showings and i of course will view again . i enjoyed the scenery of the film and felt this adds to the plots and intrigue . husband and wife heated discussions ( or should i said tussle ?) were very pragmatic . the initial situation is a common one but the escalation into the story presented fortunately is not . i want to thank all who were involved in this grand entertainment film . thank you ! looking forward to the next films --- when ? whidbey--manager
the bittersweet twist to this movie contains a wonderful element of romanticism that evokes an impetuous passion ! these characteristics of idealistic imagery which " moonstruck " possesses , spur on an end result of a resounding thumbs up verdict by virtually every prominent critic in hollywood . let me describe the circumstances to this film , simply put , they are " yesteryear ". " moonstruck " is a cohesive film which sparks the naivety of an old italian neighborhood in new york city . new york city has always been one big melting pot that is galvanized by many bicker - some mannerisms which are indicative of typical new yorkers , this encompasses a lot of italian americans living in new york as well ! the mid and late eighties brought on an abrupt conclusion to many strong associations with various cultural stereotypes . ethnicity polarization was a firmly embedded scourge in american history that was far more prevailing several generations before this movie was made . these generalizing proclivities still exist today , however , they are more mollified and less identifiable ! for this italian family of a bygone era , confusion , indecisiveness , agitation , and yes , of course , love , all have the comical camaraderie of an utterly human understanding to them ! the kindred spirits with everyone in " moonstruck " seems to be that of comprehending individual weaknesses . one might wonder about cher playing the lead role , as she is more known as an entertainer than a big box office first billing star in a movie . in " moonstruck ", however , i think she was incredibly well suited to her role , and came off as carefully believable in a relatively unbelievable situation . all of the characters in " moonstruck " are very rough around the edges , really tough , and not afraid to have a formidable duel with adversity . the most hilarious aspect to their lives is imperfection , and they are thoroughly aware of the fact that weathering the storm definitely serves a constructive targets ! i thought the acting in this movie was sensational . all relationships in this movie garner an auspicious potential to vividly illuminate because everybody knows how everybody else ' s basic nature is really like !! for this family , nothing is glamorous , nothing is pretentiously romantic , and nothing is overly emotional ( just moderately so ). the fact is , this entire family is plainly and perpetually afflicted and overcome by an extremely zealous and candid cupid in all of their lives . taking moon beams literally can indeed have a pleasantly enervating impact on one ' s resolve , masqueraded mystique , and resistance to the proverbial am ore '. thus signifying everything !! the homey and mercurial tenet in this film is basically one of ; be honest , get furious ; be honest , get confrontational ; be honest , get warped and emphatic ; most importantly ; be honest , and fall in love !! this is cher ' s best performance ever as an actress !! nicholas cage , danny aiello , and olympia dukakis , were marvelously flawed in " moonstruck " such performances by these three were perfectly appropriate for the kinetic energy of the traits in this movie ! director , norman jewison ( famous for " cincinnati kid ", " thomas crowne affair ", and most famous for " in the heat of the night " which won the academy award for best picture in 1967 ) depicts many keen and humanistic instincts in the process of purveying the deliberate incongruity to this film ! i am italian american in descent , ( partially anyways ) cher is not italian , and , for that matter , neither is the writer neither the director ! i guess since non - italians like eating our food , they may as well use our culture to make a fabulous film too ! it is refreshing to know that a film can be marvelous and have an incredibly happy ending !! for those of you who didn ' t like this movie , i just have one thing to say " snap out of it !!" this movie " moonstruck " is totally happy go lucky !! totally eighties !! and totally five stars !! see it ! !--human
a bit quirky and bordering bad taste ; but smarter enough to be worthy of watching . a wheelchair - bound young woman jane hatchard ( helena bonham carter ) is teamed with a reluctant caregiver , richard ( kenneth branagh ). richard is an artist that daydreams of human flight . he builds an airplane in his garage and intends to fly it . he wants to reanimate his own tormented life by taking care of the independent , dying jane , who suffers from an neurological disease that ha all but left her speechless and very little car skills . wheelchair - bound and full of spirit , her last dying wishing is to loose her virginity . she offers herself to richard , who wins ' t help her directly ; but is willing to rob a banque in order to paying a gigolo to do the deed . i found this flick ambitious and humorous . even in this role , carter has a certain charisma and likability .--artist

i noticed that a new hope and the empire strikes back are in the top 10 , but that this one isn ' t even in the top 100 . this movie has a inclement reputation because of ewoks , but there are so many motive to love this movie :- the rescue of han solo from jabba : this official wraps up the han solo in debt sub - plot that was established when we first met the character in a newer hope .- the emperor was finally revealled : well alright this might not work as well now that the prequels are out but this was the first time we saw the emperor as kids .- the speeder bike chase : alright , so this was a special effects moment . but it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the films !- the 3 part climax : 1 ) the combats of endor ( led by han and leia ) 2 ) luke confronts his father & the fall of the emperor 3 ) the destruction of the second death star ( lando ' s moment )- the final celebrations with our heroes : like i said , this movie gets a lot of crap because of the ewoks but i think it ' s sort of cool that while the entire galaxy celebrates the slumps of the empire , our heroes are having their own private party in the woods with each other . all in all this was a great final chapter for our heroes and a fitting end to the star wars story .--han

this is one a most famous filmmaking of the french sex empowerment of the seventies , starring gerard depardieu and patrick dewaere in hugely sarcastic roles . it is also one of the many dark psychological dramas of the seventies / eighties , such as " serie noire ", " buffet froid ", " beau pere ", all realised by blier . however , i would like to correct the preceding comments that was posted on the movie : the translated title in english is very far from the french version . it is authentic that both protagonists are " going places ", but the title in french could be literally translated by " the waltz ballerinas ", which is a metaphor for the movement of the testicles ...--french

" possibly we can arrange a meet . " " where are you now ? " " i ' m sitting in my office . " " i doubt that . " " why would you doubt that ? " " if you were in your office right now we ' d be having this talks face - to - face . " bourne remains street tough , and elusive . only his inhuman resilience leads the film a little too far into fantasy . talks is macho , to the point with only shards of bond type gallows humour . its all about the action . the feeling that there is something going on at another level to the world we live in is what the trilogy coveys so well . a scene set in waterloo with a guardian journalist does this to grand effect . there is no meeting of worlds - you are in it or just a superfluous body . if the unsteady cam doesn ' t annoy you too much , enjoy this film and hope they somehow keep the franchise going .--guardian

the third and last part of the bourne trilogy ( duh ), is lacks a bit in the story department , but covers it with broad action scenes ! twi in especial take up quite some of the running time and make this movie better . the director and star ( damon ) themselves agreed that it was difficult to find a story for the last part , because the end of the second movie was quite ... advanced tales - wise . how they got around that ? the action scenes , for once , but they did another thing too , which i can ' t uncovers , because that would be a spoiler . but if you watch the movie , than you ' ll notice it ! funnily enough i read , that this adjustment of the bourne books is the least precise of all three films .. if that means anything to you : o )--director

i caught this movie on the sundance channel on cable one late afternoon . you might say " who loves the sun " is a perfect leisurely pastime of a story , why ever not . you get to hang out with the trio : lukas haas is will ( returning after abruptly leaving everyone years ago ), molly parker is maggie ( we learn she ' s very much part of the family bloom ), and adam scott is daniel ( is he friend or foe or fiancé ), by the scenic peregrine lake , manitoba , canada , captured in graphic compositions juxtaposed in vivid summer colours against sunshine and shadows . and helps the trio are two more family members in the revealing mix : wendy crewson is mom mary bloom , and r . h . thomson is dad arthur bloom . writer - director matt bissonnette has delivered an ingenious unfolding of story - line and its different tentacle links - worry not , haas may have a ' listless ' face , but humor will come as parker and scott enter the circle of friends reunited , wry smiles will break and knowing delights stir . dialogs may be terse or even nil , yet we ' d get the flavor of what ' s cooking , baffled or wondering . yes , " who loves the sun " can very well be categorized as a sleeper gem . the chemistry between all five principals sure gels and ' combusts ', giving an energetic ensemble performance . after all , it ' s all in the family , and the film sure doesn ' t take itself too seriously . looks like the official site is still available at " wholovesthesun . com " and there are information on the soundtrack by mac mccaughan ( portastatic with guitar tunes and strings ) where score excerpts are being played , and behind the scenes production notes , interview with writer - director - producer bissonnette on how the movie and concept came about , the casting and more . have always appreciate molly parker since her spare yet mesmerizing performance in 1996 lynne stopkewich ' s ' kissed ', and she ' s married to bissonnette , who " wrote the maggie part for molly ."--director

one reviewer notes that it does not seem to matter what welles actually says or does , he moves you . i concur . he was and remains a exclusive force in film . more than a triple threat who could act , write and direct , he had a genius uniquely suited to film . one can consider whether in an earlier age he would have been a painter . this film certainly reinforces that impression . a musician , a theatre actor , an heir to shakespeare ? hard to tell but i am very grateful that his time cam with film and he have him captured on film . i like the accent . i like the confronting , the size , the style , the mind and the games . i love all of his movies and wish there were more . i specially adore how other actors interacted with him on film . many were never better or at least somehow various with him because he was o decisively there . even towards the end when his beauty was vandalized , perhaps by his own aim , he was impossible to ignore and he made every scene he was in . rita was a gorgeous blonde -- a lana turner look alike but perhaps even lovelier and even afterwards the eye goes to welles and one wishes for another minute , another film , another hour in his company . that is why we all wish we could come upon the lost scraps cut from his films because we know , we all know , that there is not part of him not worthy of our time . watch it and be grateful for the chance .--actor

dev anand ( or prashant ) and zeenat amman ( jasbir / janice ) are siblings brought up in single parent families . jasbir ( the sister ) grows up in an affluent environment but this is not enough to lead her to reject her life and ultimately join a hippie movement that finally leads her to drugs . prashant ( the brother ) on the other hand grows up in a less wealthy environs but increases up to be a mature gentleman . the story marks prashant making efforts to save his little sister ( who is perpetually in a trance ) from a hostile hippie environment . this movie stands the test of time , commenting that cults and hippie groups are a place for those who give up on their lives when they should instead stand up and be counted in the confronts of adversity . great music compositions in this movie that mean differing things in assorted situations and to various people , and the director brings forth an eerie feeling to it .--director

let ' s eradicating any conversations about the use of non - asian actors playing asian roles . the movie is 67 years ancient . in 1937 studio chiefs believed that any actor could / should be able to play any role . actors were under contracts , and did not always have a choice about what role they played . end of story . this is a really great epic story of love , individual rights , class strata , and men / women matters . the centerpiece of the film is two brilliant performances by luise rainer and paul muni . muni plays wang , a chinese farmer , who is approximately to take a wife ( rainer ). from the commences , he treats her with respect , during a time when women were looked on as little more than hired help . without giving too much of the movie away , they go through the highs and lows of all relationships , and even though the story may take place in late 19th / early 20th century , the story and much of their feelings , seems reliable . other than the fact that the movie is about 5 - 10 minutes longer than it needs to be , and the performances of charley grapewin and walter connolly are typical 1930 ' s cartoon characters , this is a really superb movie that , unfortunately , ha become a victim of political correctness . 9 out of 10--victim

basically the exact same movie as " house of wax " - vincent price ' s first genuine horror hit released the previous year - but seriously who cares , because " the mad magician " offers just as many sheer thrills , delightful period set - pieces , joyous 3 - d effects , sublime acting performances and macabre horror gimmicks as its predecessor ! " never change a winning team " is exactly what writer crane wilbur must have thought when he penned down price ' s character don gallico , another tormented soul besieged by fate and out for vengeance against those who wronged him . don gallico is about to perform his very first own illusionist show as gallico the great and plans to exhibit the greatest magic trick in history ; entitled " the girl and the buzz saw ". gallico ' s promising solo career is abruptly ruined before it even begins when his previous employer ross ormond appears on stage and shoves a contract under his nose , stating that all of gallico ' s inventions are the rightful property of the company . the sleazy and relentless ormond , who by the way also ransacked gallico ' s once beloved wife , takes off with the buzz saw trick and programs it in the show of gallico ' s rival the great rinaldi . inevitably gallico snaps and sadistically butchers ormond , but  also being a master of creating disguises  recreates his victim ' s image and even starts leading a double life . " the mad magician " is an amusing and thoroughly unpretentious 50 ' s horror movie in grand guignol style , with a whole lot of improbably plot twists ( the landlady turns out a brilliant crime novelist ?) and a handful of fantastically grotesque gross - out moments ( although they obviously remain suggestive for most part ). the 3 - d delights near the beginning of the film , like a yo - yo player and a goofy trick with water fountains , merely just serve as time - filler and contemporary 50 ' s hype , but it ' s still fun to watch even now and without the means to properly behold them . " the mad magician " is also interesting from a periodical setting point of view , as the events take place around the time fingerprints were starting to get used as evidence material and the character of alice prentiss is an obvious reference towards famous crime authors of that era . needless to state that vincent price remains the absolute most essential element of triumph in this film , as well as from nearly every other horror movie this legendary man ever starred in . like no other actor could ever accomplish , price depicts the tormented protagonist who gradually descends further and further into mental madness in such an indescribably mesmerizing way . you pity don gallico , yet at the same time you fear him enormously . you support his vile acts of retaliation and yet simultaneously you realize his murderous rampage must end in death . vincent price simply was a genius actor and , in my humble opinion , the embodiment of the horror genre .--master

this movie was fantastic . it details the struggling between a committed detective against the dedicated ignorance of the corrupted communist regime in russia during the 80 ' s . i give this movie high marks for it ' s no - held - barred look into the birth and development of forensic investigation in a globally isolated ( thanks to the " regime ") community . this is a graphic movie . it presents an unsensationalized photos of violence and it ' s tragic remains . nothing is " candy - coated " with overdone blood or gore to separate us from the cruel reality on the screen . this movie is based on russian serial killer andrey chikatilo . i ' m familiar enough with the truthful tale to have a very deep appreciation for how actual they kept the film . it ' s not a comedy , but for those who appreciates dry and dark humor , this movie is a gotta - see .--russian
i thought this was an utterly charming film . the story seems to be a thinly veiled autobiography of john waters : pecker ' s greatest gift is his ability to find beauty in unexpected places . edward furlong does well in the lead , but the best performances are by his grandmother , mink stole ( a hilarious cameo ) and , of all people , patty hearst . i think the reviewers are way off base on this one . they seem to be taking pecker ' s worst valuation of his work as gospel , when i think the film pretty clearly states that he is indeed a promising artist .--artist
i don ' t understand why the review of this film are so universally inclement , unless i ' m righteous off my rocker . i found it sick , brilliant , twisted , and psychologically sophisticated . you won ' t get deeper into the mind of a criminal psychopath in a hollywood film than this one . it has layers within layers , nuanced acting by stone , and a plot that volition keep you guessing even after it ' s over . people need to get over the fact that sharon stone is 48 , and that michael douglas isn ' t in this one . i prophesied that this film will be a gargantuan struck on dvd once people see it for themselves and stop paying attention to the drivel professional reviewers put out . give it a shot , you might be glad you did !--sick

i love this anime ! i was laughing my head off with all of the jokes and the violence ( mostly from akane ranma ' s reluctant but short tempered " fiancee ") is so slapstick however ranma does deserve it but he does try his best to make amends ... clumsily . the principal character ranma goes to china to train only to slumps into the cursed jusenkkyo spring and turns into a girl when splashed by cold water . from then on it ' s pure chaos one after another . among the stand outs are the deranged brother and sister duo of kuno and kodachi , the sexy shampoo , the pervert happosai all causing trouble for our hero / heroine . however it is ranma ' s selfish father genma who winds up underway the culprit for the mess most of the time . if anyone wanting an anime that ' s funny , this is the one . it ' s cuter and better with the japanese dub .--heroine
spoilers 9 / 11 is a very good and very realist documentary about the attack on the wtc . 2 french film makers who are in new york to film the actions of a nyfd are being confronted with this event and make the most of it . before 9 / 11 nothing much really happens which gives the movie an even more horror like scenario . on the day of the attacks it seems like just another dull day at work but this will soon change . as one the film manufacturers goes on the road with the firemen he movies the first crashing plane , this is the only footage of the first impact . he rides with the firemen to the wtc and goes inside the building . as the second plane crashes the people understand that this is not an accident . in the next period of time we see firemen making plans to save as many people as possible , in the meanwhile we hear banging sounds , these are the sounds of people who jumped down from the tower and falling on the ground , this is the most grueling moment in the documentary . subsequently the tower collapses and our french friend has to run for his life , you hear him breath like a madman while he runs out of the building . then a massive sort of sandstorm blasts over him and the screen turns black , he was very lucky to survive and now he can film the empty streets of downtown new york . because this documentary has got so much historical footage and because the film was ment to be something totally different this documentary will probably stay in everybody ' s memory . i saw the attacks live at household because i had the afternoon of , so this makes it even more realistic to watch . 10 / 10--french
as someone else has already said here , every scene in this film is gem . most films are lucky to have one scene that is perfect , but director jewison hit a home run every time . the casting got just the right take on the excellent script , and in addition , dick hyman ' s musical settings of the opera and the other music made for a impeccable matching . hard to imagine how they conserved the precise mood going throughout the long production of a film . the comedy is subtle ( principally ), and the camera - work mirror every little emotional inflection of the narrative . cher is such a comedy natural , vincent gardenia ( who i know mostly through his frank lorenzo role on all in the family until i saw him in this and then off - broadway in the 80 ' s ) deserved far greater stardom than he ever got , and aiello ' s unfortunate loser are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to giving kudos to this phenomenal cast . has jewison ever written approximately this film ? would love to read it . hard to figure out why the average rating here at imdb is so low ...--director
