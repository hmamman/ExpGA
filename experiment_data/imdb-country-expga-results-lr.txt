the thought of sarah silverman having her own show worried me at first . the films she has appeared in were not very funny and her humor is a bit off . however , i was very stunned to see her truthful colours shine in this comedy central gem . i could possibly put her on par with the likes of amy sedaris in exotic with candy -- sarah ' s characters is a veritable sociopath , very comparable to sedaris ' jerri blank . the one downfall of this show is its supporting cast . her sister ' s character is good ; funny at times , but ultimately meant not to steal sarah ' s show . however , the rest of the cast is eminently sub - par in comparison . i ' m contented , though , that comedy central has given sarah a chance to display her unique and madmen sense of self and humor .--sarah

one of my favorite movies which has been overlooked by too numerous movie goers , an observation which mystifies me . not only directed by the acclaimed ang lee , it had multiple young actors who were to become major stars , e . g ., tobey maguire ( before spiderman ), skeet ulrich ( before jericho ), jonathan rhys meyers ( before tudors ), james caviezel , simon baker , mark ruffalo , jeffrey wright , tom wilkinson , and jewel . all of the acting was resplendent and each of the actors mentioned gave memorable performances , especially meyers who portrayed an malevolent villain who murdered for the sake of killing . when the biographies and achievement of the director ( even when he won an academy award ) and the actors are listed , this film is commonly omitted from their past performances . i discovered the film on dvd by accident and it became one of my most often watched films . however , it is seldom every seen on cable . i look forward to reading what others suggest are the reasons this film is not well known .--actors

very funny film . classic film funny eddie murphy of the 80s . i saw when i was a child and i have a good memory . the classic irony of murphy does not fails , the film is funny , well done . murphy in the ' 80s made multiple films of action that represented for him a manner to joke about everything that is dangerous . the result can only be appreciated by some but ii film from 1986 up to now have alter . the atmosphere for a movie of that time is good and the special effects are good for a film of the period . a nice movie to behold and enjoy appreciating the taste of ironic murphy , an actor who ha recently disappeared . the final portion is anthologies , the likeable actor who plays the portion of the tibetan monk . that ' s it .--actor
this is the best movie i ' ve come across in a long while . not only is this the best movie of its kind ( school shooting ) the way ben coccio ( the director ) decided to film it was gorgeous . he filmed it usage teenaged actors who were still attending high school . he filmed it in the actors owned rooms and utilize the actors real parents as their parents in the film . furthermore the actors were filming too using camcorders making it seem much more like a video diary . it is almost artful . ( if that is indeed a word ) there are a few slip ups nonetheless , for example when cal calls brads (?) land rover a range rover ( or vice versa , it ' s been awhile since i ' ve seen it )--director

sudden impacts tends to be treated as eastwood ' s artistic failure at a point in his career when he had established a good reputation as a director . the reason is actually not the film itself but the attitude it takes towards vigilantism which it seems to support . in some places it actually owes more to death wish than the original filthy harry film . one might argue if that is so - at the end of the day it ' s a film about culpa , justice and retribution . for me , at the end of the day it ' s more empathy than sympathy . however , in view of all these arguments it is easily overlooked that sudden impact is an horribly well made film . forget the " go ahead punk , make my day scene ", that ' s iconic but not original . but look at the views of san fransisco taken from the air , zooming in on the city . the first 15 or 20 minutes are quite remarkable . or have a look at the brilliantly made scene where sondra locke ' s character visits her mentally ill sister in hospital . eastwood makes great use of the juxtaposition of faces . so all in all sudden impact is a very visual film that really shows how mature eastwood is as a director . and if i remember correctly it was actually the first time eastwood put that on screen albeit in an action film of debatable ideology . furthermore , i think this is the first well paced film eastwood directed . though eastwood has huge talent as a director , dramaturgy has always been his puny point ( behold play misty for me , breezy etc .) thepace of the narrative leads to the visual elements being well integrated into the film and not distracting from the story . the only thing that is really annoying is the farting dog .--director

( i believe that lucille ball may have modeled her later career on davies ' style , that could be termed " zany beauty ".) vidor ' s direction is light but sure - handed , the stories is a chestnut of course but the acting is splendidly contemporary , and the star - watching element for fans of the silent era , with multiple cameos , adds to the overall fun . it unites the elements of slapstick with adult drama and good old timeless romanticism quite well . for all movie fans who have a knee - jerk reaction to watching mute filmmaking , sit through this one and it may change your attitude .--fans
this is unlike any other movie , the closest thing i can compares it to is a woody allen film ... but where as woody allen is constantly fathoming human vulnerabilities bret carr appears to be trying to figure out a way to get to grips with that one crippling insecurity that tends to defining us for better or worse . in the case of lou , it is the root cause of his stuttering , which can be traced back to a singular child hood trauma that is revealed through flash backs . there are so many strangely neurotic people in the world and i believe they all deserve a chance for redemption , though diversity of human characters is after all what makes the world such an intriguing place , so maybe we shouldn ' t fix our neurosis anymore than we should fix our noses or titties . this is an indie film shot on a long shoestring , but the production values are prodigious as is the scope of the film . i feel like its a quirky gem for the self - support market . i really look forward to seeing what this filmmaker does next , i could imagine a career along the lines of woody allen or albert brooks , although usually when a guy like this breaks through , he goes off and makes " x men " and his unassuming quirky origin are soon forgotten or are they .... x men is aout a bunch of freaks if i remember correctly :)--human

simon pegg plays a crass crude and frequently out of controls celebrity journalist who is brought from england to work for a big american magazine . of course his winning ways create all sorts of complications . amusing fact based comedy that co stars kristen dunst ( looking rather grown up ), danny huston , and jeff bridged . it collaborated predominantly because we like simon pegg despite his bad behavior . we completely fathom why kristen dunst persists to talk to him despite his frequent screw ups . i liked the film . its not the be all and end all but it was a nice way to cap off an evening of sitting on the couch watching movies . 7 out of 10--american

this movie is amazing for several reasons . harris takes an enormously awkward documentary and turns it into a relevant social comment . groovin ' gary is a small - town kid who is ( assumed ) well - liked for his many imitations . when he decides to play olivia newton john in a local talent show ( for whom he is very passionate ), gary ' s actions show that he is at odds with the conservative social environment in which he lives . this results in him making various justifications for his measures so that people will not think that he is in fact a transvestite or other such social outcast . in the second installment , harris exploites the struggles between gary and beaver in a novice attempt to make a narrative out of the original documentary . the third and final installment to the trilogy is truly staggering for harris ' extreme sensitivity with the subject . unlike the second installment , " the orkly kid " shows gary as a really troubled characters . he struggles to gain acceptance within his own community to no avail . his secret passion for dressing like olivia newton john distances him even further from the people that already consider him a social outcast . the movie is depicted so realistically that , like reality , it lends itself to many reactions . surely , one can see gary as a ridiculously miserable character , but may also identify with him as an outcast .--kid

this is one of the most boldness and important of the so - called " pre - code " films made in hollywood during the 1930s . unlike some pre - code films that occasionally dabbled in subjects that would have never been allowed after 1934 - 5 , this film fully immersed itself in a very sordid yet entertaining plot from initiation to finish . the conventional morale of the late 30s and 40s was definitely not evident in this film , as the film is essentially about a conniving woman who sleeps her way to the top -- and with no apologies along the way . this " broad " both enjoyed sex and used it on every man who could help her get rich -- something you just never would have seen in films made just two or three years later . the film begins with barbara stanwyck working in her father ' s speakeasy . in addition to being her boss , he is also her pimp and encourages her to sleep with a local government official so that he ' ll allow the illegal bar to operate with impunity . while not especially clear here , it appears as if daddy has been " renting " his daughter ' s body out for a long time . however , after nearly being raped and attacking this man by breaking a bottle of beer over his skull , barbara ha ha enough and heads to the big city . it doesn ' t hurt that the still blew up and killed her father , but her feeling that she was whoring herself out and had nothing to show for it appeared to be the impetus to move . despite the depression , barbara uses sex to get a job at a immense mega - bank . she starts out at a pretty menial job as a file clerk , but in the space of what seems like just a few weeks , she sleeps her way from one job to another to yet another -- until she is sleeping with the head of the bank and his future son - in - law !!! this all ends in tragedy , but babs doesn ' t seem too shook up over the deaths of these two men . in fact , some time later , she is able to insinuate herself into the life of the novel ceo and once again she ' s on top ( perhaps in more way than one ). now so far , this is a wonderful movie because it was so gritty and unrepentant . barbara played a 100 % sociopath -- a woman with no morality and no conscience -- just a desire to squeeze as much out of life as she could no matter who she hurt in the process . however , the brave writers and producer " chickened out " and thought it important to tack on a redemptive ending . considering that this woman was so evil and conniving , her change of heart at the end was a major disappointment and strongly detracted from the film . in many ways , this reminding me of the ending of jezebel -- as once again , a wicked person somehow " sees the light " and changes at the not - too - convincing conclusion . my advice is to try watching red - headed woman and downstairs . red - headed woman is much like baby confront but features no magical transformation at the end -- the leading lady really is a skunk down profound ! in downstairs , a film very much like red - headed woman , the roles are reversed and a man ( john gilbert ) plays a similar conniving characters . both are classics and a bit better than this film . this film is an amazing curio of a brief period of often ultra - sleazy hollywood films and in this light it ' s well worth seeing for cinephiles . also , fans of the duke take note -- john wayne plays a very small part in the film and it ' s very unusual to see a very young wayne playing such a conventional role .--woman

as many reviewers here have noted , the film version differs quite a bite from the stage version of the story . i have never seen the stage version of the story , and hence i have a more favorable review of the film than many other reviewers . perhaps richard attenborough was not the best choice for director of the film , but the film is still an entertaining account of several dancers trying to make the big time in choreographer michael douglas ' show . the film does right by not selecting any famous actors or performer to wind up in the final attempt - out group . this way our attention is concentrates on the dancers ' movements and individual stories and struggles as they unfold during a marathon day of attempts - outs . douglas is also probably not the best choice for the part . apparently some songs were cut out in favor of a new one , and the backstage cliché - ridden story of a romantic liaison between a dancer and the choreographer was adds . i have to say in all fairness this was the weakest part of the film . the repeated intrusions cassie made during try - outs appear to mirror the roughly desperate pleas one often has to make when engaging in the artistic professions in the absence of talent and / or luck . however , this aspect of the film has been done to death in the past , and it ' s curious to see this tired old shoe kicking its heel up once again . the revelations of the dancers themselves began promisingly enough with the " i can do that " number , but then it plodded a little at various points while the dancers were telling their tales . honestly , their stories differed little from real life folks who never get a chance like this . *** of 4 stars .--director

midnight cowboy made a big fuss when it was released in 1969 , drawing an x rating . by today ' s standards , it would be hard pressed to pulling an r rating . jon voight , who has been better , is competent in his role as joe buck , an out of town hick wanting to make it big with the ladies in new york city . he meets a seedy street hustler named ratso rizzo , who tries to befriend buck for his own purposes . the two ultimately forge a bond that is both touch and pathetic . as ratso , dustin hoffman simply shines . hoffman has frequently been brilliant , but never more so than in this portrayal . he is so into character that all else around him pales in comparing . losing the academy awarding to john wayne is one of the most ludicrous decisions ever made by the academy of motion photography artistic and sciences . director schlessinger has a deft hand with his production , but this film has a grungy underbelly that leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the viewer . worth seeing for hoffman ' s performance alone .--director

i remember watching this as a infantile in the uk , mesmerized by the story and lawrence olivier ' s narration . we would talk about nothing else at tuition the next day . i imagine the ratings for the first showing were overwhelming . this is quite simply the best most comprehensive documentary series despite the fact they had to cut the story down to the bone they managed to capture so much . what is interesting is that the struggles of britain and north africa were pivotal yet are widely unrecognized as such by americans . the series captures the rivalry between mountbatten and the american generals , the suffering of german troops on the eastern front , the maltreatment of japanese detainees of war by american troops . the photo of the holocaust made me , a non - jewish european , feel forever guilty about the treatment of the jewish people . i don ' t know why this is not number one in the imdb rankings . maybe they are illustrating their bias against documentaries . spoiler - we win .--american

" jag är nyfiken  yellow " is a lot of fun . like at least one other reviewer , i was , on numerous occasions , laughing out loud . yellow is energetic , playful , self - aware , explorative . don ' t expect bergman here . this movie is approximately a youth in the early - to mid - 60s in sweden and about the issues , read * contradictions *, that the nation and the world were facing . at times yellow appears to be an earnest social - politically documentary , with lina , the main character , and others interviewing both common people and politicians ( e . g . olaf palme at home ). at other times , yellow seems to parody this kind of documentary . all the while , yellow acts as a personal documentary exploring lena ' s life - her home life , her loves , her political views , her view of herself . she is a finishes person  complex , flawed , contradictory , happy , sad , odd . and placed over all of this is the sumptuous additional dimension of the director , sjöman , and his crew documenting themselves documenting lena . it is this that , for me , really gives yellow wings . not exclusively do they suddenly appear at some very funny times and in some funny ways , reminding the viewer that this is fiction and artifice , but their presence is itself another layer of the film ; they are filming themselves filming themselves . i am reminded of a bjork music video with this same quality  a music video around the making of a music video , ad infinitum , with each iteration getting weirder and more cartoonish . i think sjöman may have had something similar in mind . while " jag är nyfiken  yellow " may not be everyone ' s cup of tea , it is assuredly intelligent , witty , refreshing , ebullient , and authentic .--director

eglimata (= crimes ) is a story about little crimes everyday people commit that in a lunatic scenario could lead to the absolute disaster . one of the smartest greek serial ever ! actors like ketty konstadinou and maria kavogianni showed a whole new dimension of themselves and talent and gave us moments of incredible ' guilty ' laughing . every viewer seemed to acknowledged the bad side of their self in one of the traits or at least a side of their self they wish they had . actors of every age that played bigger and smaller parts gained an equally big space in greek audience ' s heart . my personal favourites ( apart the first two i mentioned ) are vassilis haralambopoulos , athinodoros prousalis and stavros nikolaidis but so many staggering actors passed by some episodes from time to time . whoever around the world understands greek should find a way to watch this series , even though it ' s been more than 5 years that it was on televisions . in greece they keep repeats the series ( ant1 ) in every opportunities there is like summertime or early afternoon zones . we ' ll never forget eglimata orr any of the casting crew !--actors

the alternate title of ecstasy , is symphony of love ; a title which appropriately describes the mood and feel of the film . ecstasy is an early talkie , and could have very well been a classic film , if released during the mute film epoch . this film is a visual treat , and is deliberately paced so the viewer can savour its sensuous lyric quality , which is presented in an artistic low - key fashion . the director ' s style is distinctly european . the subject matter and approach to sexuality was far more sophisticated , than what was being produced in hollywood , at that time . consider the censorship code in the us , during the 30 ' s , that pretty much sums it up . hedy lamarr , one of the grand beauties of all time , was a irreproachable choose for this ' philharmonic of adores .'--director

felt it was very balanced in showing what jehovahs witnesses have accomplished in protecting american freedoms . it also showed the strong faith of two families who were first generation witnesses . i also appreciated how it showed how by becoming a jehovahs witness affects non - witness familial members and how hard it is for them to accepting the fact that they don ' t celebrate holidays , the sad part is that non - witness familial do not think of having their witness family over for family dinners / visits or give them gifts at any other times but for vacations or birthdays . when it comes to medical care the witnesses want and expect a high standards of medical care , what people forget is that blood transfusions allows for sloppy medical care and surgeries whereas bloodless treatment causes the medical team to be extremely skillful and trained , which would you prefer to treat your loved ones ? i highly recommend this video !--american

first than anything , i ' m not going to praising iñarritu ' s short film , even i ' m mexican and prideful of his success in mainstream hollywood . in another hand , i see most of the reviews focuses on their favorite ( and not so ) short filmmaking ; but we are forgetting that there is a subtle bottom line that circles the whole compilation , and maybe it will not be so pleasant for american people . ( even if that was not the main purpose of the producers ) what i ' m talking about is that most of the short films does not displays the suffering that wasp people went through because the terrorist attack on september 11th , but the suffering of the other people . do you need proofs about what i ' m saying ? look , in the bosnia short film , the message is : " you cry because of the people who died in the towers , but we ( the others = eastwards europeans ) are crying long ago for the crimes committed against our women and nobody pay attention to us like the whole world has done to you ". even although the burkina fasso story is more in comedy , there is a the same thought : " you are angry because osama bin laden punched you in an demonic way , but we ( the others = africans ) should be more angry , because our people is dying of hunger , poverty and aids long time ago , and nobody pay attention to us like the whole world has done to you ". look now at the sean penn short : the fall of the twin towers makes happy to a lonely ( and alienated ) man . so the message is that the power and the greed ( symbolized by the towers ) must fall for letting the people see the sun rise and the flowers blossom ? it is remarkable that this terrible bottom line has been proposed by an american . there is so much irony in this short film that it is close to be subversive . well , the ken loach ( very know because his anti - capitalism ideology ) is much more clearly and shameless in going straight to the point : " you are irate because your country has been attacked by evil forces , but we ( the others = latin americans ) suffered at a similar date something worst , and nobody remembers our grief as the whole world has done to you ". it is like if the creative of this project wanted to say to americans : " you see now , america ? you are not the only that have become victim of the world violence , you are not alone in your pain and by the way , we ( the others = the non americans ) have been suffering a lot more than you from long time ago ; so , we are in solidarity with you in your pain ... and by the way , we are sorry because you have had some taste of your own medicine " only the mexican and the french short filmmaking showed some compassion and sympathy for american people ; the others are like a slap on the face for the american state , that is not equal to american people .--american
