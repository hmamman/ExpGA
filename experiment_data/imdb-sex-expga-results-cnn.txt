there is a lot of crap coming out of hollywood lately . a friend , send me movies now and again , as a surprise , it ' s awesome . i turned it on and couldn ' t stop watching , it is a drama , but with a bizarre twist . imagine if romeo , as in shakepeare , had a super power . it is sorrowful and poetic at the same time . hollywood should take notice of the novel russian cinema , they are telling stories that are not about big explosions and cgi . it takes a simple basic premise and tells a story , without a spectacle . this is a lot like an asian film with a dark russian twist . granted it ' s not perfect , but nothing ever is . you know what the power is but it is never explained , nor totally realized until the end . it becomes secondary to the emotion of the story . i don ' t want to see a remake , it is too refrigerate as is , the hollywood system would , as usual , muddle it up . acting is top notch all around . directing and camera work are far above most of the crap that is out there . kudos to all involved , and i will turn a lot of people on to this independent epic . a +++++ if you can find i , watch it .--russian

i grew up in brazil and i used to visit and marvel at the beautiful coast where the movie was filmed . the area is called " parati " and is part of the " green coast " of the rio de janeiro state . it is some 150 miles from the rio de janeiro city . this movie brings back to life the world of 16th century brazil , where europeans were barely starts to explore the coastline , which was still in pristine state and sparsely populated by several native tribes . french and portugese fought each other for territory and for the upper hand on the brazil wood traded , all the while negotiating with the aboriginal , who also fought each other for whatever reasons . one french misfit (" a mercenary ") is left to die by his own compatriots but manages to escape and is kept prisoner by an all - naked native tribe . while he is a " slave " of the chief , according to the customs of the tribe , he is allowed to live in relative comfort for months until the time is right for him to be assassinated and eaten in a ritual of vengeance . what i love around this film is that it recreates in loving detail the natives ' village and their way - of - life ( they walked naked and were cannibals ) and asks us to recognize and accept the life in those times as it was : in a gorgeous garden - of - eden , life was untidy , violent , full of pathetic superstition and weird customs . the europeans arrive and bring their own problems , including more violence with better weapons and greed . there is no romanticized " noble savages " or " heroic explorers " here , it is just people trying to survive in a tough world . the movie is neither unduly sympathetic nor dismissive of the natives . from what i know of the subject , the depiction is fairly accurate which adds an air of uniqueness to the project : how many movies have you seen regarding the lives of brazilian natives and their early affairs with europeans ?--french

just watched this movie on dvds and thought the acting was very good , but the over all story left a lot to be desired . this movie ha the same texture and look of panic in needle park or drugstore cowboy . tough to believe that human beings can live this type of lifestyle ; on the underbelly of society , in which their total existence is based on hardcore drug use , crime , violence , sex , and a total lack of self - respect for anyone or anything , including themselves . val kilmore is outstanding in his role of " burnt - out " former porn star john holmes . the supporting cast is just as good . nonetheless , this is a bleak , dark , disquieting , and depressing film . the slain was brutal , but the daily lives of these people were brutal as well . unless you have an interest in these murders or were a " fan " of john holmes , this really isn ' t a film to behold . if you want to see a docu - theatrical on assassinate , truman capote ' s 1960s in cold blood starring scott wilson and robert blake is much better .--human

ira levin ' s deathtrap is one of those mystery films in the tradition of sleuth that would be very easy to spoil given any real examination of the plot of the film . therefore i will be brief in saying it concerns a play , one man who is a famous mystery playwright , another man who is a promising writer , the playwright ' s wife who is much younger and sexier than the role should have been , and one german psychic along for the ride . director sidney lumet , nos stranger to film , is quite good for the most part in creating the tension the film needs to motor on . the dialog is prompt , fresh , and witty . michael caine excels in roles like these . christopher reeve is serviceable and actually grows on you the more you see him act . irene worth stands out as the funny psychic . how about dyan cannon ? love how lumet packaged her posterior in those real tight - fitting pants and had her wear possibly the snuggest tops around , but she is terribly miscast in this role - a role which should have been given to an older actress and one certainly less seductive . but why quibble with an seeming attempt to bribe its male viewers when nothing will change it now ? deathtrap is funny , sophisticated , witty , and classy . the mystery has some blatant flaws which do detract somewhat , and i was not totally satisfied with the ending , but watching caine and reeve under lumet ' s direction with levin ' s elevated verbiage was enough to ensnare my interest and keep it captive the whole length of the film .--director
wasn ' t sure what to expect from this movie considering its stunning collection of stars and directors but in the end it didn ' t disappoint . for me one of the stresses was the final episode with the american tourist speaking with a horrible french accent ( which made me feel better about mine ) which was actually pretty touching and a great way to wrap up the movie . the story of the paramedic and the stabbing victim was furthermore very moving and for pure comedy the coen brothers and steve buscemi take the award . the tom tykwer clip was additionally impressive although rather ambitious in its scope . however , the bob hoskins segment was utterly cringeworthy and the vampire story was completely farcical . the dialogue in wes craven ' s section also felt very forced and the chinatown story was totally incomprehensible . on the whole this film is worth watching for the good bits and has a strong finish . it ' s not too painful to sit through the bad sections - they only last 5 minutes anyway . ca vaut la peine !! !--french

dragon hunters has to be the best - looking animate film i ' ve ever seen . it was jaw - dropping . the film is about a couple rogues in search for some cash , their weird furry blue dog that pees fire , and a girl who dreaming about becoming a knight , and they are forwarded on a quest to go to the ends of the earth to kills the world gobbler , an impossibly gargantuan dragon . but honestly , it doesn ' t even matter what the film is about . because , it is jaw - droppingly marvelous . the gravity in this fantasy world is different , so blocks of architecture and spheres of land float around amidst cathedrals and castles and villages alike , and there are forests of floating lily pads . the world is so creative , so uniquely splendid , with a sort of muted storybook look to it . the world looks like a set of sumptuous painting . the monsters are visually stunning as well , like a fire dragon comprised of a swarm of evil red bats . some of the plot isn ' t too original , like the main protagonists wanting their farm a la of mice and men and never seem to be able to make it in the world ; but the gorgeous graphics , some seriously sinister scenes , and emotion - evoking dialog makes this film spectacular .--girl

having been a fan of ' columbo ', i was desperately disappointed in ' corky romano '. while certainly a funny movie , falk ' s mob boss character was a far cry from the lovable lieutenant he ' s played for so many years , particularly with the offensive language he used . after ' corky romano ', i was honestly both surprises by and soured on mr . peter falk . nevertheless , having just seen ' finding john christmases ' and its predecessor , ' a town without christmas ', for the first time within a week of each other , i have to say that ' max ', peter ' s falk ' s delightful character in both movies , is surely as memorable and loveable as ' columbo '. while parts of the movie are quite predictable , such scenes in nos way take away from the enjoyment of seeing the story played out . i too wishing i had recorded both of these heartwarming christmas movies , and i exceedingly recommends them whether you ' re a falk fan , a christmas nut , or simply someone who enjoys the occasional feel - good movie of the week . this movie may end up lost among the throngs of made - for - tv holiday flicks , so be sure to find ' finding john christmas ' before it ' s too late .--fan

the 63 year reign of queen victoria is perhaps one of the most documented and popularly known historical reigns in british history . on the one hand , her story lacks the theatrics of earlier royals thanks to a change in social climate and attitudes , and on the other her story is one that perpetuates because it is notably human . taking on the earlier years of her life where the budding romance between herself and the german prince albert was taking forefront , director jean - marc vallée who has only until recently remained in the unnamed shadows of the industry here takes victoria ' s story and captures that human element so fundamental to her legacy . it ' s a story that feels extremely humble considering its exuberant background , and yet that ' s partly what gives it a distinct edge here that separates it from the usual fare . taking a very direct and concentrated approach that centres in on a brief five or so year period between her ascension and marriage to albert , the young victoria does what so little period pieces of this nature offer . instead of attempting a sprawling encapsulation of such a figure ' s entire life , vallée instead opts to show one of the lesser known intricacies of victoria ' s early years which are easily overlooked in favour of the more publicly known accolades . the result is a feature that may disgruntle historians thanks to its relatively flippant regards to facts and the like , yet never to let document get in the way of extracting a compelling story , writer julian fellowes sticks to his guns and delivers a slightly romanticised yet convincing portrayal . vallée takes this and runs , making sure to fully capitalise on those elements with enough restraint to maintain integrity in regards to both the history involved and the viewer watching . a major part in the joy of watching the young victoria play out however simply lies in the production values granted here that bring early 1800 ' s regal britain to life with a vigorous realism so rarely achieved quite so strikingly by genre films . everything from the costume designs , sets , hair styles , lighting and photography accentuates the grandiose background inherent to victoria ' s story without ever over - encumbering it . indeed , while watching vallée ' s interpretation come to life here it is very hard not to be sucked in solely through the aesthetics that permeates the visual element ; and then there ' s the film ' s score also which works tremendously to further the very elegant yet personal tones that dominate fellowes ' script . entwining the collaborate of schubert and strauss into victoria and albert ' s story not only works as a point of reference for the characters to play with , but also melds to the work with an elegance and refrain that echoes composer ilan eshkeri ' s original work just as well . yet for all the poignant compositions , lush backdrops and immaculate costumes that punctuate every scene , the single most important factor here  and indeed to most period dramas  are the performances of the cast and how they assisting bring the world they exist in to life . thankfully the young victoria is blessed with an equally immaculate ensemble of thespians both young and old that do a marvelous job of doing just that . between the sweet , budding romance of victoria ( emily blunt ) and albert ( rupert friend ) and the somewhat antagonistic struggles of her advisors and the like ( spearheaded by a marvelous mark strong and paul bettany ), the conflicts and warmth so prevailing to fellowe ' s screenplay are conveyed perfectly here by all involved which aid keep the movie from being a plastic " nice to look at but dim underneath " affair so common with these outings . in the end , it ' s hard to fault a work such as the young victoria . it ' s got a perfectly touching and human sense of affection within its perfectly paced romance , plus some historical significance that plays as an intriguing source of interest for those in the audience keen on such details . of course , it may not take the cinematic world by storm and there lacks a certain significance to its overall presence that stops it from ever becoming more than just a poignantly restrained romantic period drama ; yet in a sense this is what makes it enjoyable . vallée never seems to be striving for grandeur , nor does he seem content at making a run - of - the - mill escapist piece for aficionados . somewhere within this gray middle - ground lies the young victoria , sure to cater to genre fans and those a little more disillusioned by the usual productions ; beautiful , memorable but most of all , human .- a reviewing by jamie robert ward ( http :// www . invocus . net )--human

in 1979 , i was a boy of 12 years old , my parents had just got the houses box office which was pretty novel to our neighborhood . as a 12 year old boy , this was the first time i saw titties on television . i will never forget the delight of those times . racing vans , the total butt - wipe with the baddest van , the water bed , the smoking of herbs , the hot 70 ' s chicks , the ' makin love in my chevy van song , it was all so new to me . a complete movie with all of the memories you could hope for . i own it and enjoy it about once a year . when i watch this movie , it makes me want to get my skates , with 4 wheels , not in a strait line , go to the park and hunt down some babes with feathered hair . genuinely grand memories of young adolescence !--boy
the latest film by the spanish director agusti villaronga is a study on how children that experience violence and isolate within their remote community , develop into troubled young adults that need certain psychic tools to deal with their hidden mental frailty . whether these tools are religious followed to a fanatical level , caring for others or simply putting on a macho image whilst engaging as a male - prostitute , villaronga creates a successful review of how these vices affect three teenagers living in spain under franco . the three witness the disturbing doubly deaths orr their friends before they are teenagers and subsequently bury the emotions they feel with their peers frail corpses until they meet again once more at a hospital for those suffering form tuberculosis . the cinematic style of the text is typically visually opulent as you would expect from the spanish auteur and is extremely reminiscent of fellow spaniard pedro almodovar ' s work with themes dealing with sexual desire , both heterosexual and homosexual . an element that is different between the two directors is that villaronga favours a supernatural undertone spliced with claustrophobic , gritty realism opposed to almodovar ' s utilizes of surrealism , although both styles are similar . the piece gives an insight into troubled young psyche and contains disturbing violence and scenes of a sexual nature . i exceedingly recommend watching this film as it contains elements that will remain with the audience for a considerable timeframe after visualizing .--heterosexual

i remember the original series vividly mostly due to it ' s unique blend of wry humor and macabre subject matter . kolchak was hard - bitten newsman from the ben hecht school of big - city reporting , and his gritty determination and wise - ass demeanor made even the most mundane episode extremely watchable . my personal fave was " the spanish moss murders " due to it ' s wholly original storyline . a poor , troubled cajun youth from louisiana bayou countries , takes part in a sleeping research experiment , for the purpose of dream analysis . something goes inexplicably wrong , and he literally dreams to life a swamp creature inhabiting the dark folk tales of his youth . this malevolent manifestation seeks out all persons who have wronged the dreamer in his conscious state , and brutally suffocates them to death . kolchak investigating and uncovers this horrible truth , much to the chagrin of police captain joe " mad dog " siska ( wonderfully essayed by a grumpy keenan wynn ) and the head sleep researcher played by second city improv founder , severn darden , to droll , understated perfection . the wickedly funny , harrowing finale takes place in the chicago sewer system , and is a series underlined . kolchak never got any better . timeless .--captain

if , like me , you like your films to be unique , and unlike the majority of other movies , then i wholly recommended that you check out the beast . the film is a grotesque , erotic , fantasy fairytale that centres around a mythological ' beast ' that is rumoured to wander the grounds of a french mansion and lusts after women . the film is very daring with it ' s subject material , and that is something to give it credit for . the theme of bestiality is a definite taboo , and for good reason , i might adds ; but the film conveys it ; straight and to the point . like other films that handle a taboo subject at their centre , the beast could have gone around it , and made us use our imagination to fill in the gaps , but borowczyk didn ' t do that , and he is brave in that respect , especially as making a film like this will leave him open to all kinds of criticisms , but the fact that he went ahead with it , in my view , means a large thumbs up for the guy . the film starting off with a sequence that sees a randy male horse mount a female . this opener puts an exclamation mark on the film and prepares the audience , in some ways , for the incredible , tour de force of eroticism that they are about to see . the scenes which see the beast mate with the woman are gratuitous and shocking , and are bound to offend many people ( thus the reason it was prohibiting for over 20 years ), but these scenes are not merely an excuse for borowczyk to shock the viewer ; this film has a defining point . as said during the film ; the only difference between man and beast is intelligence . both man and beast have instincts , only man knows how to control them . the beast explores this difference between man and beast through sexuality ; the fantasy sequences in which the beast appears epitomises the control of human desire , and it is only when the central female character lets go of her control that she can see the beast . the film has strong themes of the age - old story of ' beauty and beast ' weaved into it , and overall this is a shockingly morbid tale of lust , but not without a moral . multiple criticise the scenes around the film ' s shocking sex sequences for being boring , but these scenes are important to the film ' s story . without these scenes , we wouldn ' t get to know the characters or the story of the beast , and , most importantly ; the story of ' beauty and the beast ' would not be able to have it ' s horrifying conclusion dealt to the audience , and as that is one of the key elements of the film ; it would be a real shame . besides that , borowczyk keeps his audience entertained through these scenes , not with shocks , but with dialogue and the upper class persona of the family , along with the beautiful shots of the mansion ' s ground would not be seen , and therefore the stark contrast between that and the events later on in the film would not exist either . overall , the beast is a shocking film . it ' s portrayal of a taboo subject and the shocking way it is portrayed will ensure that this film is not for everyone . however , if you can get over the film ' s shock , and embrace the beast ; what awaits is a skilful and handsome piece of art that should not be missed by anyone that is willing to give this film a chance .--female

the stone boy is an almost forgotten drama from the 1980s . considering how many famous or soon to be famous people are in the film , one wonders how it could have been so overlooked . this is a slow , moody , but touching account of a tragedy that befalls a farm family . the film is more or less an indictment of midwestern stoic values and suppression of emotion . the film will not be for all tastes , but anyone who can appreciative real human drama should like it ok . in the early moments of the film , we see two brothers head off in the early morning hours to pick some peas and maybe shoot a duck or two if they ' re lucky . while climbing through a barbed wire fence , the gun inadvertently discharges and the younger boy fatally shoots his older brother . these boys have apparently never taken a hunter safety course . the way for two men to properly go through a fence like this with one gun would be as follows : frst man climbs through . second man then passes him the gun through the fence . the first man then sets the gun down and helps the other through the fence . at no time should either man have his hands on both the gun and the fence . anyway , once his brother is killed , 12 - yr - old arnold regresses into his own world . he does not even run for assistance after his brother is shot . he simply goes ahead and picks the peas and tells his family about the accident later . at no point during the funeral or inquest does arnold seem to show any regret or sorrow at all . his family seems to shun him . perhaps they are even angry at him for killing his brother . an ornery uncle played by frederick forrest is outwardly upset with arnold , even though the older brother ' s death allows him to hit on the kid ' s girlfriend . arnold ' s parents don ' t seem to understand how to deal with their son . they really don ' t even try to talk to him . about the only person he can communication with is his grandfather who is played in typical grandfatherly skill by wilford brimley . after a while , arnold even moves in with the old timer . nothing seems to get arnold to open up until he takes a bizarre road trip to reno nevada to inexplicably look up his uncle ' s ex - wife . once he meets her , he begins to emerge from his shell after apologizing to her for breaking up her marriage by commence all of the family ' s turmoil with the accident . from here on , the film becomes a quick study in reconciliation and reawakening . the acting is hauntingly distant in most cases . robert duvall and glenn close make the flawless stoic farm parents . forrest is good , but maybe trying too hard to channel paul newman ' s performance in hud . the cinematography is extraordinary , too . if you like moody picture about common folk , this one may be for you . some even may be advised to bring some tissues . 8 of 10 stars . the hound .--human

" gespenster " ( 2005 ) forms , together with " yella " ( 2007 ), and " jerichow " ( 2008 ), the gespenster - trilogy of director christian petzold , surely one of the creme - de - la - creme german movie directors of our time . roughly , " gespenster " tells the story of a french woman whose daughter had been kidnapped as a 3 years old child whilst the mother turned around her head for 1 minute in berlin - and has never been seen ever . since then , the mama keeps traveling to berlin whenever there is a possibilities and searches , by assists of time - dilated photography , for girls of the age of approximately the present age of her age . as we hear later in the movie , the mother was already a lot of times convinced that she had found her daughter marie . however , this time , when she meets nina , everything comes quite differing . the movie does not bring solutions , not even part - solutions , and insofar , it is rather disappointing . we are not getting equipped either in order to deciding if the mother is really insane or not , if her reales daughter is still alive or not . most disappointing is the end . after what we have witnessed in the movie , it is an imposition for the watcher that he is let alone as the auteur leaves nina alone . the simple walking away symbolizing that nothing has changed , can be a strong effect of dramaturgy ( f . ex . in " umberto d ."), but in " gespenster ", it is displaced . since critics have been suggesting freudian motives in this movie , let me give my own attempt : why is it that similar person do not know one another , especially not the persons that another similar person knows ? this is quite an madman question , agreed , from the standpoint of aristotelian logic , according to which the notion of the individual holds . the individual is such a person that does not share any of its defining characteristics with anyone else . so , the aristotelian answer to my question is : they do not know one another because their similarity is by pure change . everybody who is not insane , believes that . however , what about the case if these similar persons share other similarities which can hardly be by change , e . g . scarfs on their left under ankle or a heart - shaped birthmark under their right shoulder - blade ? this is the metaphysical context out of which this movie is made , although i am not sure whether even the director has realized that . despite our modern , aristotelian world , the superstition , conserved in the mythologies of people around the globe that similar people also share parts of their individuality , and that individuality , therefore , is not something erratic , but rather diffusional , so that the borders between persons are open , such and similar believes build a strong backbone of irrational - ism despite our otherwise strongly rational thinking - a source of gespenster of the most interesting kind .--french

' intervention ' has helped me with my own addictions and recovery . i ' m a middle - aged married father of two . i ' m quite functional in my personal and professional life . still , i have pain from my past that i use addictions to soothe , and issues from which i am slowly recovering . when these addicts and their families share their lives with me , they support me to improve my life and my relationship with my family . the exposition , unlike many others , digs into the past of the addict and reveals events that probably caused their addiction . many of us suffer because it ' s too scary to go back and do , as alice miller says , " the discovery and emotional acceptance of the truth in the individual and unique history of our childhood ." the show deserves a lot of credit for at least getting this process started . this digging is painful and difficult , but worth it . so much coverage of addiction -- fictional and non - fictional -- seems to ignore the underlying issues . often it ' s assumed that the addict just one day begin to shoot up or whatever for fun or pleasure or self - interest , and now they can ' t stop . not so : addictions are about murdering pain . i can relate to the varying events and hardships in people ' s lives . there are common themes , and surprising exceptions . many addicts have suffered deplorable abuse . some kids simply answer badly to divorce . to those who think that addiction is an over - reaction to a hardship , i would just say that different people respond differently . although some kids handle divorce well , others , like cristy in the show , " collapse in a heap on the floor " and have their lives forever changed by the event . for example , last night ' s councillor said that pretty young andrea seeks validation from men . she strips for cash for a 75 - year old neighbor and lets men abuse her . sound familiar to anyone ? the series is filled with information that we can use to understand our own motivations and make adjustments to our lives . often it ' s those of us with smaller issues who suffer the longest . as they say , even a stopped watch is right twice a day , but a slow watch can go undetected for quite a while , until it ' s made your life miserable . to the producers : thank you for making the show , for digging into the past , for the follow - ups . also , the graphics , the format , and the themes music are brilliant . to the addicts : thanked you for your courage to share . whether or not you have helped yourself , you have helped me .--professional

this splendidly - directed fantasy is the second in the popular by flawed tarzan series put out by mgm . it is a first - class adventure for many reason , i suggest -- fine photos , strong imaginative qualities , a delightful cast , good simulated - jungle locales and a very exciting storyline . johnny weissmuller plays tarzan , a mono - syllabic untutored sort unlike edgar rice burroughs ' creation ; but he is honest , faithful , brave and very courageous , and he needs to be during this narrative . as jane parker , his wife who had been jane porter in the novels , maureen o ' sullivan is very attractive and lively , as well as being athletic where the script calls for that quality . the effect of the lighting , the spacious and clever sets is quite unusual . this is an outdoor adventure filmed on the mgm back - lot which really collaborate . the fabulous mutir escarpment is a remote locale which allows tarzan and jane to live undisturbed ; but into their idyll come people searching from them , emissaries of a civilization jane has left behind and into which tarzan could not really be comfortably habituated . one is harry holt , still in love with her , who with his friend tempts her to come back to civilization with him ; the gown and perfumes interest her , but she refuses to leave tarzan . tarzan has to protect her against several wild animals , in scenes that look like a humanized king king . the group claim to want to hunt animals , and tarzan agrees for jane ' s sake to a bit of big game trapping ; but at some point , the idea of ivory and of obtaining a fortune turns the despatch ' s heads ' minds . tarzan is shot , left for dead ; and the group force jane to accompanies them on an expedition as they follow a dying elephant to the gorgeous " elephant ' s graveyard ". but they find the area guarded by a savage tribes and are attacked by lions . tarzan rides in on an elephant he has revived in time to call ; in a most spectacular elephant - filled scene , he saves jane and what is left of the dispatch , who return home little richer but much wise , as jane continues her savage idyll with her new husband . the film was directed by set - design wizard cedric gibbons , and quite beautifully too . his work and the lighting are the outstanding accomplishments of this entertaining and exciting film , which manages to seem real despite all its hollywood shortcomings from startup to finish . neil hamilton is a very good harry , paul cavanagh is even better before and after he reveals himself to be thoroughly bad . forrester harvey and nathan curry round out a small cast very professionally . an unusual and well - realized fantasy film with interesting situations and some strong dialogue confrontations as well . recommended .--jane
i enjoyed this movie , and after watching it , it made me wonder just how many ' caitlin rose ' s ' exist in the world . how many other girls have been subjected to this sort of sexual abuse , and torments by schoolmates and have been too afraid to open their mouth roughly it ? righteous how threatening and cruel can teenagers be towards one another , because as this film demonstrate , who ' s right is not foremost important , its who is popular , and feared which manipulates the minds of youngsters , and influence them to allows this sort of immorality to happen . tiffani amber thiessen gives a influential performance as the rape victim , and brian austin green is convincing as the guy torn between the girl he idea he loved , and his best friend . this is the kind of film that doesn ' t get the exposure it deserves . remarkable , and resplendent , too good to be just a film made for tv .--victim

this is a totally delightful and unexpected film . you begin by following a young person who hopes to get into the qualifying football game between bahrain and iran . if iran win they will get into the 2006 world cup in germany . the problem is the young person is a girl and girls ( or women for that matter ) are not allowed into football matches to " sit with men ". what follows is a fabulous comedy , played with consummate skills by a small ensemble cast . the film explores the absurdity of limitations on the freedom of women ( and for that matter the young soldiers who have to corral them ). there are some marvelous set pieces , not least when one of the girl must go to the toilet and , of course , the stadium has no lavatories for women . the camera work is of the simplest and in some ways this story could have been told as a stage play . yet it is the little scale that gives the film its bite . grand cinema ? no , probably not ; great entertainment - for sure .--girl

i recently watched the ' 54 version of this film with judy , and while i appreciated the tale and music , i found that the film failed to held my attention . i expected the ' 76 remake to be the same story , except with a barbra twist . i was pleasantly astonished - it was a much more realist and moderne look at fame , money , loves and the pricing of it all . this version is so much more real than the ' 54 one , with arguably better music , better acting , a more gripping plot line , and , of course , a deeper love . i do not understanding why the previous film is on the american film institute ' s top 100 listings , while this gripping remake fails to make a mark on any critic ' s listings .--american

this film resembles in numerous ways ` enemy of the state ' with will smith and gene hackman , as we have an innocent ( black ) man being pursued by the ` government ' with all the modern technology known to man . usually when storyline is copied like this the result is a disaster . that does not apply here . of course i adores everything david morse does , so maybe my comments are not fair , but there were more good things about this film then that . the main baddy , played by doug hutchison , was brilliant , and the tales flowed with wondrous extras such as david paymer and robert pastorelli . our hero , alvin sanders ( played by jamie foxx ), was however irritating most of the part . he is so out of place , cracks bad jokes , evoking no sympathy from the audience . or not to initiate with , the strange thing is that he kinda grows on you ( and on his enthusiasts as well !). i didn ' t expect much when i rental it , but was astonished with a good solid action movie with comedy bits . 7 / 10--enemy

the power of kangwon province is director hong sang - soo ' s second features effort and clearly much of what he initiated with in his previous film returns in this film , including the multiple related narratives ( in this case , two ), and stories of troubled or troubling relations , as well as a potent dosage of irony . one thing that ' s clearly lowered from his previous work is the flights of fancy that included elements of surrealism . however , this film moreover contains a single moment of surreal that strikes a contrast against the otherwise rather realistic depiction found therein . the two stories follow a young woman who goes on a trip to kangwon province with her friends , only to find herself drawn to a stranger , the second about a man who also goes on a trips to kangwon province with his friend and struggles with his relationship woes . again , hong shows a strong understanding of irony and of the flaws in human nature and yet i don ' t think he ' s totally unsympathetic when it comes to his characters , drawing in just enough compassion to offset the criticism he draws with his irony . i think the think i ' ve come to love about hong ' s films is that they just feel so real , especially the complex and conflicted characters . not to say that every person is a hypocrite or suffering from confused feelings , but rather , that these characters he and the actors present , feel fully developed and believable . this is not a fast moving film . there ' s a batch of lingering and like the previous film , things don ' t always connect immediately so patience does pay off and in surprising ways . there doesn ' t appear to be any element of the film that isn ' t intentionally placed in the film and it ' s made my a little hyper - aware of various seemingly extra characters as they get dragged into the mix as the film progresses . power is an excellent film that manages to inject a level of personal emotion , regret , longing into a story that highlights irony and the fallibility of human decision - making . it ' s a rather hard balance to keep and it ' s surprising how hong manages to pull it off twice in a row . technical production values have gotten much better since the first film and direction has gotten steady and unambiguous . this film doesn ' t pack the same emotional wallop that the first does , but gains a lot in its assured exploration and the refinement really helps tighten the overall vision . great viewing for art cinema lovers . 8 / 10 .--human

one of the larger hits of 1926 , brown of harvard is a enthralling comedy / drama featuring regatta and football scenes that gave william haines the role he needed to become a major star . it ' s patented haines all the way : feisty smart aleck who takes nothing serious until he is disallowed by everyone wises up and becomes a man / hero and won the girls . no one worked this formula like haines . a wondrous comic actor ( little annie rooney with mary pickford , show people with marion davies ), haines could swing from comedy to tragedy with a modifications in facial expression . he is a total joy in this film as he was in tell it to the marines ( with lon chaney ) and west point ( with joan crawford ), where he repeats the formula . mary brian is good as the girl , jack pickford is very good as the sickly roommate , ralph bushman is the rival . eduard connelly , mary alden , david torrence , guinn williams , and grady sutton co - star . this film is noted now for its homoerotic relationship between haines and pickford and for being john wayne ' s film debut as a yale football player ( but i never spotted him ). haines was a top - five box office star starting with this photos through 1932 . it ' s a shame he has been largely forgotten and that most of his films appear to be lost . he was one of the most appealing and talented actors of his time .--man
one of the grandest hits of 1926 , brown of harvard is a exciting comedy / drama featuring regatta and football scenes that gave william haines the role he needed to become a major star . it ' s patented haines all the way : brash smart aleck who takes nothing serious until he is rejected by everyone wises up and becomes a man / hero and wins the girl . no one collaborated this formula like haines . a fantastic comic actor ( little annie rooney with mary pickford , exhibition people with marion davies ), haines could swing from comedy to tragedy with a change in facial expression . he is a total joy in this film as he was in tell it to the marines ( with lon chaney ) and west point ( with joan crawford ), where he repeats the formula . mary brian is good as the girl , jack pickford is very good as the sickly roommate , ralph bushman is the competitor . edward connelly , mary alden , david torrence , guinn williams , and grady sutton co - star . this film is remarked now for its homoerotic relationship between haines and pickford and for being john wayne ' s film debut as a yale football player ( but i never spotted him ). haines was a top - five box office star starting with this photos through 1932 . it ' s a shame he has been largely forgotten and that most of his film appear to be lost . he was one of the most appealing and talented actors of his time .--man
" anchors aweigh " is the product of the classic mgm musical production unit , and on the whole the film is every enjoyable  good music by jule styne and others , excellent dancing by gene kelly ( and even a passable job by candid sinatra ), and a funny well - paced script . the only major element i would criticize would be the casting of kathryn grayson , whose presence in a film always means the audience will be subjected to endless pseudo - operatic warbling from the petite miss . kelly plays a naval serviceman named joseph brady , a man with a mythic reputation around the ship as a lover but whose valentino - charms are constantly being subdued by the presence of his less cocksure friend with the improbable mid - american name of clarence ( sinatra ). upon receiving 3 days of shore leave for saving clarence ' s life , joe reluctantly agrees to help clarence find a girl based on the doubtful premise that he owes him something for saves his life . they are drafted by a policeman ( rags ragland ), who needs them to help coax a precocious young boy ( dean stockwell ) who wants to join the navy into returning home to " aunt susan " ( grayson ). at first it is clarence who is interested in wooing " aunt susan " but eventually kelly ' s character emerges as the more likely candidate . there are numerous standout musical scenes but nothing to come close to kelly ' s more famous work in films like " singin ' in the rain " and " american in paris ". the closer we get is a gimmicky sequence with kelly ' s character in a fantasy sequence dancing with jerry , the mouse from " tom and jerry " ( although he seems to be closer in size to a dog or cat here than to a mouse ). it ' s a startling sequence for its time but doesn ' t have enough complexity or emotion to really stand the test of time . i actually enjoyed the parts of the sequence that took place prior to the animation , where kelly was using semi - balletic moves to emphasize the transition into the fantasy world and where we see him dance down a tunnel that looks like something right out of " alice in wonderland ". eventually the characters find their way to susan ' s favorite bar , a somewhat sanitized mexican restaurant / bar in tijuana . there the patrons happily allow ms . grayson to chirp her arias with abandon , and the management becomes very excited at the chances that clarence and joe have extended for her to sing with their " friend " nunez iturbi ( playing himself with a light humorous touch ). of course they ' ve never met their " friend " iturbi and they spend much of the film ' s length trying to reach him ( in an amusing scene sinatra ' s character meets iturbi but mistakes him for a piano tuner and urges him to abandon tuning pianos and try a professional career ), sneaking into the studio and the hollywood bowl , where iturbi is rehearsing a surreal symphony comprised of dozens of young piano players  you haven ' t seen anything like this outside of " 1000 fingers of dr . t ". iturbi himself is a kind of a god - figure in the story  he represents the opportunity for salvation from the drudgery of unfulfilling working and the possibility for fame and artistic achievement for the heroine . everyone is 100 % sure that as soon as mr . iturbi so much as hears ms . grayson , her operatic career will be a reality . the 3 primary characters are desperate to reach him and they think of him as some kind of remote and distant mythological figure  a lot of the film ' s charm and humor comes from the contrast of this perception to the very down - to - earth " real " mannerisms of the maestro . and speaking of iturbi ' s contributions to the film , he also provides a very stimulating musical moment with his orchestral interpretation of " donkey serenade ". when all is said and done , this is a film that nobody who enjoys musicals will want to miss . the majority of the music was written for this film , a nice contrast to recycled soundtracks for other kelly opuses like " rain " and " american ". kelly is still at his early peak , adventurous and boisterous in both his dances and his interpretation of the character . sinatra ' s voice was never in better form and he rarely ha better songs to sing . stockwell is a charming addition to the clan , and grayson ' s character is endearing when she isn ' t posturing on stage . iturbi adds that well - grounded but sophisticated tone that perfectly matches the atmosphere and style of the classic - era mgm musical . this is one of the better ones .--lover

one of my favorites films for a number of years was " last activities hero "; unfortunately , arnold schwarznegger decided to spoil my fun by becoming a corrupted scumbag politician ; so now i can ' t bear any film he may had a hand in . the adventures of jake speed actually toys with some themes similar to those in last ... hero ; so i was pleased to find it on dvd , so i could watch these themes played out so well . despite the " plot - within - the - plot " involving white slavery during an african nation ' s civil war , this is not an action movie . the plot that the " plot - within - a - plot " is within , is actually about a question that the film has no intention to resolve : is jake speed a real person that is helping the heroine save her sister from the white - slave trader ; or is he actually a fictional character ( which means that the heroine has somehow entered the universe that really only exists in a series of pulp novels )? i suggest that this is not all that clearly defined in the film , and that wayne crawford and andrew lane are perfectly aware of this . the film thus becomes a presentation of what audiences may want from such a fictional " adventure - tale " universe . that ' s actually a rich theme , the potential heaviness of which is lightened by the film ' s amiable and campy sense of humor . there are demerits to the film - chiefly it ' s cinematography , which makes the film look like a tv exhibitions . and the pacing does sag on occasion . but i really like these characters , and i enjoy the adventure they live , however idiotic . and i just find fascinating the idea that this adventure is actually taking place in a novel . holds up under multiple viewings - m good shows !--african

the old mill pond is more of a tribute to the african - american entertainers of the ' 30s than any denigration of the entire racing ( stepin fetchit caricature notwithstanding ). moreover who i just mentioned , there ' s also frog or fish versions of cab calloway , fats waller , joesphine baker , bill " bojangles " robinson , and louis armstrong . this merry harmonies cartoon from hugh harmon and rudolf ising is very entertain musically with impeccable characterizations all about . they all sound so much like the real thing that half of me thinks they could perhaps be . if not , they ' re certainly very flattering impersonations . even the lazy , shiftless fetchit characterization gets an exciting workout here when he gets chased by a tiger as " hold that tiger " plays on the score . exceedingly recommended for fans of ' 30s animated and jazz music .--baker

i enjoyed this movie quite a batch . i have always been a fan of whoopi goldberg and this movie only emphasizes it . she portrays a housewife in an african - american familial which is moving up the social chain due to the husband ' s ( danny glover ) success as an solicitor . she moves to an all white neighborhood where the people are friendly , yet a little awkward towards her . the several events that arise during the course of the movie make for some laugh but mainly appeal to the other emotions . this movie is not so much a comedy as a drama . i give it a strong 8 / 10 . i tremendously recommend you catch it on televisions or rented it shortly .--african

believe it or not , inspector gadget ' s last case is what got me hooked on the whole gadget thing . my name is miriam and i am twelve years old , so obviously i wasn ' t around when inspector gadget was at the top of his career . sure , i ' d heard of him , but i didn ' t really know him . while reading , note that i never saw the original series ( i would if it came on !). this is just circa the only gadget thing i ' ve ever watched ( even though i am now obsessed ) and i will be focusing on what i liked circa it since everyone else is so negative . for all you pessimists , i ' ve got some cons down there , too . = p first off , for a childish sense of humor , you could deem this movie pretty funny . i thought it was , so sue me . i also thought the animation and character designs were good , and i ' m also happy there was more gizmo in it , since he ' s my favorite character . ( i do not like penny .) then there was claw ( his voice was awful , though ) and the madcat ; i thought they were done fairly good too . gadget ' s idiocy seemed pretty well in place , if not a bit exaggerated ( i . e . sucking his hat - hand thing ' s thumb . would make a good screen shot , though . = p ) oh , and i liked the song that ran in the credits . yes , i am strange . and , like all movies , there are some negatives , too . speaks motor ? what ' s up with that ? you can tell this was aimed at younger boys . that wouldn ' t bother me quite so much if there wasn ' t the fact that the cars basically saved the day . i would have much preferred if penny and brain had taken their place . and , apparently , gadget loved his motors more than would be called natural . a bit weird , to say the least . oh , and the chief was downright mean to gadget . i mean , sheesh , yeah , he wasn ' t always the most cheerful of people , but he didn ' t hate gadget , from what i ' ve read . like the inspector , his personality was exaggerated . well , that ' s quite much all i have to say about this movie . i thought the animation made up for the motorcar - centered plot and that it was overall pretty decent ; more so than the live - action gadget film ( butchered , butchered , massacred !) at least . maybe i ' m just biased because this is what got me into gadget in the first place , or maybe my mind is twisted , or maybe i ' m just odd , but i really liked this movie , even if i ' m the oldest it ' s recommended for .--inspector

nothing revolutionary here ; just impeccably elegant , confined cinema . garde a vue is confined nearly exclusively to a drab policeman station , and mostly to one interrogation room , but director claude miller ( who made the excellent film this sweet sickness , among others ) intercalates spare glimpses of exterior tableaux as minimalist locale scenography . miller ' s restraint , especially early on , is breathtaking , and his exquisite handling of the consequently - pivotal interior mise - en - scene makes for captivating viewing . lino ventura is superb as usual , succeeding to legitimize a character that , on paper , is cliche : the laconic , hard - nosed , world - weary homicide detective . ventura lives the role , making it abundantly believable , even though the script allows us little accessing to his inner workings ; the film ends at the very moment it appears he will be forced to confronting his failure for the first time . michel serrault is equal to the task as the suspected enfant - killer who shrewdly spars with the single - minded flic . the exchanges between the two are more - often - than - not pregnant with tension and the aura of a permanently metamorphosing playing field for a battle of wits . serrault ' s character is by turns deplorably haughty and cunning , and pitiable ; then later .... the " message " of garde a vue , if one were to search for one , is a condemnation of police methodology and the kind of pressures that make a cop over - zealous to , if necessary , close cases at the expense of justice . for most of its length though the film shines as nothing more than an exemplar of how to turn a potentially soporific set - bound scenario into a suspenseful drama of the utmost cinematic economy .--director

this is a frank loesser masterpiece of fun lyrics , competent themes and solid construction by those who adapted damon runyon material to the musical ' s " book ". what is surprising about the film is how seamlessly the musical numbers flow from the storyline . abe burrows did the book with contributions from loesser ; michael kidd was the choreographer , and the outstanding art direction was contributed by joseph wright . the storyline can be told in two sentences . nathan detroit , played by frank sinatra , needs cash to finance his permanent floating crap game to amuse big julie , a chicago mob boss . he bets odds - player sky masterson , well - presented by marlon brando , that he cannot get a salvation army girl to go to havana with him ; masterson wins the bet , saves the mission , falls in love with the girl , gets the gamblers and riffraff at the crap game to attend a service , and tells everybody the lady was impervious to his charms -- a finishing lie . of course he ends up with the lady ; and detroit marries hi long - suffering fiancée , vivian blaine . others in the cast include stubby kaye , johnny silver , robert keith , b . s . pulley as big julie the mobster , sheldon leonard , regis toomey , mary alan kokanson , kathryn givney as the salvation army leader , veda ann borg and jean simmons as the tepid salvation army girl , sarah brown . the famous musical numbers in this award - winning broadway smash include " fugue for tinhorns ", " guys and dolls ", " chance be a lady ", " i ' ll know ", " a person could develop a cold ", and " the oldest established permnanet floating crap game in new york !". joseph l . mankiewicz of " cleopatra " and " letter to three wives " fame directed the proceedings ; and the flow of the working is very interestingly and successfully kept moving . he is equally adept at getting fine dialogue acting and directing such huge numerals as " luck be lady ", the differs and challenging brawl section , the havana " a woman in love " section created for the film that precedes it , the presenting of the title song " guys and dolls " and " pet me , poppa " set in the club where blaine works . the acting is very uneven . simmons seems wrong for the part at times , brando gets by with the singing and is very good much of the time on instinct , charm and underplaying , even in the comedy . scenes . sinatra tries hard but is wrong for the role for several reasons as nathan detroit ; blaine is a bit too - theatrical in selling her numbers , which she of course sings professionally . leonard , toomey , kaye , keith and pulley do what is asked and more at all points . the stylized opening and closing are made to work well ; all in all , this film is a triumph for loesser ' s friendly and subtle lyrics , for director mankiewicz as ringmaster , and for the genre of musicals itself , so ably justified in this instance . delightful and very diverse .--leader
loved it but still have nightmares over the hotel manager . the movie , was presented well , with the opting of actors carrying their roles to reality of the writing . many scenes gripped the imagination and created a nail biter . the progress of circumstances were cleverly written , making me believe the story was headed one way only to find a new twist on what i thought might be the apparent . too bad there have to be commercials . i have told many friends to watch for further showings and i of course will opinion again . i enjoyed the scenery of the film and felt this added to the plots and intrigue . husband and wife heated discussions ( or should i say fighting ?) were very pragmatic . the initial situation is a common one but the escalation into the stories presented fortunately is not . i want to thank all who were involved in this great amusement film . gratitude you ! looking forward to the next films --- when ? whidbey--manager

after seeing this film at the sf independent film festival , i couldn ' t wait to hear about how to get a copy . jim mckay gave a talk ( q & a ) about the film afterward which presented his ironic situation : how to get distribution for a film which portrays minorities ( women , non - whites ) working on resolving controversial issues ( teen pregnancy , adolescence maternity , racial identity , single - mum household ), and how to write a faithful script on all of these topics being a mid - thirties white male . the multi - racial , multi - gendered audience of mostly - adults raved about the film ' s beautiful storyline , detailed characters , and resplendent portrayal of " real teen life ." most of the teens , however , had left the building -- leading me to think this is a film best seen by adults with kids , as a starting point for discussion rather than , as many adults there felt , " a film teens should see because it ' s roughly them ." hence , distribution questions -- how do we get our hands on it ? the internet ( retail ) would be a great path -- this is a film that will be buried , like " pups " or other radical modern adolescent films -- and mckay seemed responsive . as for his credits as a writer / director , mckay was _extremeley_ sensitive and detailed in his work -- allying himself to the crown heights neighborhood in which the film is set , work with actors to portray characters in their own vision of what they think should be -- with the results being disarmingly realistic .--director

there are numerous films relating to ww2 , but mother night is quite distinctive among them : in this film , we are introduced to howard campbell ( nolte ), an american living in berlin and married to a german , helga noth ( lee ), who decides to accept the role of a spy : more specifically , a cia agent major wirtanen ( goodman ) recruits campbell who becomes a nazi propagandist in order to enter the highest echelons of the hitler regime . nonetheless , the deal is that the us government will never recognise campbell ' s role in the war for national security motives , and so campbell becomes a hated figure across the us . after the war , he tries to conceal his identity , but the past comes back and haunts him . his only " friend " is wirtanen , but even he cannot do much for the avalanche of events that dips upon poor campbell ... the story is deeply touching , as we watch the tragedy of campbell who although a great patriot , is treated by disdain by everybody who surrounds him . not only that , but he also gradually realizes that even the persons who are most close to him , have many secrets of their own . vonnegut provides us with a moving ambience , with campbell ' s despair building up and almost choking the viewer . nolte plays the role of his life , in my opinion ; he is even better than in " affliction ", though in both roles he plays tragic figures who are destined to self - destruction . sheryl lee is also gorgeous , and the same can be said for the whole cast in general . i haven ' t read the book , so i cannot appraise how the film compares to it . in any instances , this is something of no importance here : my critique is upon the film per se , and the film sincerely deserves a 9 / 10 .--patriot

the 60 ´ s is a well balanced mini serials between historical facts and a good plot . in four deliveries , we follow a north american family , with 3 members . but we don ' t only see them . we also follow the story of several characters as a black reverend , an extremist student leader , and a soldier in vietnam . the filmography is just extraordinary . in the first chapters , we see some shots of the vietnam war , in between the scenes . the next chapter , doesn ' t started where the last one finished , it starts some time after , giving us a little enigma on what happened . in general , the 60 ´ s mini series , is a must see , not only for hippies fanatics , but for everyone with little curiosity circa the topic .--leader

after a love triangle story in har dil jo pyaar karega these 3 stars were again picks in this disputed flick . the film would have been considered as hit if there was not a controversy with the production values from bharat shah . here director duo abbas - mustan did a very different and unique job as compared with their previous and after directorial ventures . they are considered as thriller makers of bollywood . but in this cccc they proved that they can equally handle to make a romantic family drama . hardly there is a single action scene when preity was being raped by salman ' s colleague in her apartment , salman slapped him . the movie has almost all the standards and ingredients like song , story , casting , performances etc . which are required to make a movie hit . but of course for salman ' s fan this was somethings a surprise gift from him . why ? because for so long he has been doing roles where he has a scene to show his open body and dance la - la - la all around . his role as a rich young businessman who has no - nonsense nature and of normal attitude is really impressive . after all madhubala , a whore role performed by preity is amazing . later when she too turns out thoughtful about her life she deserve proper attention . her facial expressions and body language become more attractive , and focus mainly goes to her . her previous role as a pregnant woman in kya kehna was not that heart - touching as it is here . of course , this can be termed as improvement . then priya , a very innocent and helpless wife of raj who only depends on him for a better result . she has nothing powerful influence in the tales as the main ingredients are in the hands of preity . lastly , the main point of the story which is something rare and unique in itself . in real world of this age it is not totally impossible to happen such step of searching for a alternative mum . perhaps , many are happening in this large world where these are kept secret . and in this way the scriptwriter of cccc has uncovered a hidden truth which is taking place in others daily lives . but still then it is a doubt .--director

john holmes is so proverbial , he ' s infamous ( as the three amigos would say ). this is a rashomon - like story circa the events surrounding the wonderland murders of the early 1980 ' s , in los angeles . the story is pieced together from the retelling of a few of the participants . there is story from the friend ' s perspective , namely david lind ( played by dylan mcdermott ). he is a participant in the robbery assault at eddie nash ' s place ( eddie nash is a infamous drug dealer - and is the suppose to be the same character alfred molina played in boogie nights ) and is heavily into the drug scene . there is john holmes ' perspective ( played by val kilmer ), which makes him out to be a pawn stuck between two kings ( with a severe case of cocaine cravings ). there is also the patchwork recollections of john ' s wife ( sharon - played by lisa kudrow ) and his girlfriend ( dawn - played by kate bosworth ) that filling in the spaces between the two stories . it is essentially the same time frame that we are looking at , just each character ' s version . the only thing that is missing is the standpoint from the dead people . paul thomas anderson ' s boogie nights portrays john holmes as a slightly heroic character , with a tragic yet comedic karma . he is a caricature of a real person . he was more of less , a mixed up kid that got what he got through his " large " endowment . director james cox turns the comedy off and makes this episode in john ' s life into a nightmare for all of us watching . the details of the real life murder make this movie even more eerie . val kilmer took what he learned of jim morrison , from the doors , enhanced the performance for the salton sea , and then further enhanced that to bring us the deterioration of john holmes through cocaine . all of the actors pull off very realistic looking portrayal ' s of cocaine junkies . josh lucas ' performance stands out as one of the best in the movie . he plays ron launius ( i think this character is suppose to be the same as the thomas jane character from boogie nights ). ron was the leader of the gang , loved having john holmes around as a novelty and had a cocaine craving like sharks enjoy blood . the cocaine use seems so realistic as to make one think . did they really use splenda ?? where boogie nights has a bubblegum pop feel to it ( lots of color and 70 ' s nostalgia ), wonderland is dark . the action is fast and furious , with a lot of leaps . it is twitchy and grainy . there is no comedy , just a never ending pace , as if the director is trying to put us into the nervous , fast paced , edgy cocaine high to make us feel what the characters are feeling . this is a graphic movie . it has one of the most intensely violent scenes i have ever seen in a movie . it actually exhibition the murder themselves ( through the eyes of john holmes at first and then from a third person perspective ). it is so graphic , it looks like police evidence of a crime . i had to pause after this scene and remind myself this was just a movie . this movie is definitely not recommended for everyone . i recommend it as a good alternative to boogie nights , for those interested in the other sides of john holmes .- celluloid rehab--director

resplendent film that reveals how people are connected to the taken for granted , ordinary beads exchanged during mardi gras . the film is much more than a comment on globalization . in fact , it humanizes the workers in china , the owner of the factory , the bead distributor in new orleans , and even the revelers in new orleans . what stands out the most is the director ' s ability to tell a difficult story with complicated details in such a uncomplicated and tempting way . his astounding access to the factory is another aspect that ' s intriguing and i only wish i knew how he got inside . it ' s a handsome story without sentimentality or guilt associated with it , and the conclusion furnishes hope without leaving people feeling alienated .--owner

' presque rien ' is a magnificently observed portrait of the experiences of a young french homosexual . eschewing both stereotypes and sermon , it ' s a beautifully naturalistic film , beautifully acted , shot with a feel for the seaside town where the action takes place , never melodramatic but often painfully real . if anything it ' s roughly too realistic , as there ' s little in the way of conventional plot , just scenes from a life . but the absence of conventional dramatic tension counts for less than it might in a world so subtly drawn . ' presque rien ' might not be the most exciting film ever made ; but its uncomplicated humanism serves it well compares with the pre - designed festive or bigoted viewpoints that often mar treatments of this topic . worth a watch .--french

eskimo is a serious movie roughly the cultural chasm between an indigenous population and the encroaching white man . although filmed in a documentary style seemingly with non - professional , eskimo is a skilled production that contains a believable story the audience will want to see through to the final shot . the native eskimo simply has different beliefs and behaviors about women and life than do the whalers that darken his landscapes . when an eskimo man loses his mate , it is natural that other men share their women with their friend . it is also customary for their women to want to take the placing of the missing spouse . all of this seems natural in the context of the desolate foreboding arctic setting . the trusting eskimo falls prey to unscrupulous white whalers ( with heavy european accents ) that do not view these natives as their equals . deceit , drunken orgies , rape , and death occur after the eskimo men depart for work on the icy cold seas . finally the lead eskimo ( mala ) realizes that he has been deceived and he takes his reprisals . the audience would have cheered in the 1930 ' s theaters . enter the royal canadian mounted police and the moral dilemma of whether to bring back mala for trial . the mounties are played as feeling policemen that know this is not a cut and dry case . will the mounties get their man ? is it fair to hold inclement to a code of behavior outside of his traditional society ? is there a way out that does not punish mala ? is it inevitable that the white man ' s law must prevail ? is there no hope for innocence ? this is not a great movie , but one that you will enjoy for the depth of the issue addressed in a very different setting . i suspect that the filming of the sequences with animals was done before today ' s disclaimer that none were injury in the making of the film -- so beware of the raw nature sequencing . extremely recommended .--friend

stardust another guarded review ( originally written june 15 , 2007 ) the marketing machine has only just started for this one ( no site yet ? wth ? ), so i doubt most of you have heard approximately it . in truth , i hadn ' t either ( sort of ). when i got the posting , i ideas it was another code name and was actually worried it was transformers , one of the movies i want to see when not working so i an enjoy it 100 % as a mere mortal movie - goer . turns out , it wasn ' t transformers and i had been aware of it way back when as ' that neil gaiman movie '. what is it around ? well , in short , it ' s a gaiman fairy tale about a boy and a fallen star . any more than that and i ' d be giving away plot info which is ( a ) a breach of contract , and ( b ) spoiling your fun . if you really want to know what it ' s about , go buy the book . rumour has it , gaiman might be something of a writer . not knowing what to expect in a movie can be so pleasant if the surprise is worthwhile . and for this one , it certainly was . this screening was ' special ' in that it included not just film critics , but also exhibitors ( they rarely have a mixed screening ) and local sci - fi / fantasy folks . so , you know the expected audience , right ? i mean , with this crowd and the title of stardust , i knew what to expect . oh how sweetly wrong i was . yes , it is a fairy tale written by an author famed in comic bookdom . but it was not lord of rings . it was not even another lord of the rings wannabe ( ahem , eragon ). it was much more intimate than all that . but , like seigneur of the rings , it was the , well , humanism of the film which sells the fantastical qualities . it ' s undeniably a romantic tale , but with generous splashes of humour . and that humour is of the sort which is not slapstick shrekism . it ' s more along the lines of dramedy than comedy . before i go on , let ' s do this movie review thing . acting is , in the very least , good . it ' s always hard to say more than that for fantasy films but i do believe there were significant superbly acted roles . michelle pfieffer is not , sadly , one of those . she plays a villain , and she does the job . nothing special . rupert everett , though , he was a real jerk . that is , a great villain . peter o ' toole is , well , peter frickin ' o ' toole -- which is awesome . ricky gervais is perfectly cast and illustrates why . robert de niro seemed to be having too much fun for the most part . when he wanted to deliver the commodity , though , he did . and charlie cox ( who ?) as the lead character was fine surprise from a guy i ain ' t never heard of . claire danes . claire danes . claire danes . i ' ve always been of mixed opinion with her . she can be great , and then she can seem to miss the mark . in this , she ' s the former . and she is , quite literally , the star of this film . sure , her accent stumbles here and there . and , yes , she ' s not as good as she can be when cox isn ' t in the scene . however ... well , see for yourself . special effects are muted yet accomplished , and only significant where they should be . best flying ship yet -- sorry potter . direction is light - hearted and flows nicely . cinematography could have been better but not everyone films in new zealand . all else is top bracket . and now that that ' s done ...... the writing . ah , the writing ! neil , you devil . it ' s hard in today ' s climate to do anything original and , at first , you begin to wonder . a kingdom , a dying king , a boy out to prove his own worth , witches , ghosts , a quest ( or three ) -- what ' s new ? but gaiman ' s story draws you in with its surface familiarity only to subvert it all into a sweetly original tale of a boy and his heart . and , though you suspect how it ' s all going to turn out , you begin to wonder in the third act and -- if you ' re me -- find yourself pulled into the rousing climactic confrontation and hoping for the best . in the end , you ' ll find this story , this movie , is what all fairy tales should be but all too often are not . fantastical and real . ( i wish i could talk about septimus vs tristan but i won ' t ruin it for you . for those who read the book , rest assured , it ' s done properly . ) those i spoke to afterward had the same impression i did . a great film for all ages to enjoy , and the new { withheld } for this generation . the blank gets filled - in only after the movie is in wide release because , well , you might be expecting it . you ' ll know when you walk out , anyway . i sincerely hope stardust doesn ' t get lost among the tentpoles . even if it does , it ' ll be my pleasure to push into the hands of everyone i know .--- forgot to add the { withheld } reveal . i ' m a few years late , but ... " a great film for all ages to enjoy , and the new the princess bride for this generation ." perhaps a bit lofty an assessment but i ' m still confident that years form now , there will be the same " oh , i love that movie ," response to this as there is now for the princess bride .--boy

this movie was striking , it is the kind of movie where you watch it and rather than look at other movies by actor you look at other movie by director / writer . sandler did a good job working a character outside of his comfort zone and the always good cheadle did a grand job too . this movie is great for a mature smart audience . the acting was superb and can only be surpassed by the writing and directing of the film . this film concentrates on the real americans , the past generation , no stereotypes or racism just people who have come together and realized the genuine meaning of life . this film is about loss and coping . instead of picking on psychiatrist , it defines it , not as someone who heals you magically , but rather through the necessity of talking out your feeling to an impartial anybody you can trust will not judge you , but rather will guide you though your thoughts . this movie is all round staggering !--writer

this movie was superb . it details the struggle between a committed detective against the dedicated ignorance of the corrupted communist regime in russia during the 80 ' s . i give this movie high marks for it ' s no - holds - barred look into the birth and development of forensic probe in a globally isolated ( thanks to the " regime ") community . this is a graphic movie . it presents an unsensationalized picture of violence and it ' s tragic remains . nothing is " candy - coated " with overdone blood or gore to separate us from the cruel reality on the screen . this movie is based on russian serial killer andrei chikatilo . i ' m familiar enough with the authentic tale to have a very deep appreciation for how real they conserved the film . it ' s not a comedy , but for those who appreciates dry and dark humor , this movie is a gotta - see .--russian

home room really surprises me . in comparison to other movies that were written regarding columbine high school this one is the best . habitation room does not exhibition the schooling shooting but rather the aftermath and the effects of the community and the town . the movie concentrate ' on two opposite characters ., alecia ( busy phillips ) and deanna ( erika christensen ). alecia is an outcast who witnessed the entire shooting . she seems to exhibitions no emotion about it . deanna is a popular girl and the exclusively surviving victim . alecia is forcible to visit deanna at the hospital in decree to graduate . meanwhile the police are examining alecia as she might have known the shooting was going to happen . alecia and deanna are very different and do not get along at first . eventually they develop a mutual understanding for one another and become friends . ( very much in the style of the breakfast club ). households room beautifully shows the power of closeness and turmoil after a school shooting . i would recommends this film to anyone and everyone .--victim

i thought this was an utterly loveable film . the stories seems to be a thinly veiled autobiography of john waters : pecker ' s greatest gift is his abilities to find beauty in unannounced places . eduard furlong does well in the lead , but the best performances are by his mamie , mink stole ( a hilarious cameo ) and , of all people , patty hurst . i think the reviewers are way off base on this one . they seem to be taking pecker ' s worst valuation of his work as gospel , when i think the film pretty obviously states that he is indeed a promise artist .--artist
