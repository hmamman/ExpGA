this documentary was very thorough and exposing , and at the same time entertaining , which i thought was rather impressive . i felt as if they did a very good job covering the sport from its ' origin till present day , but however , there is a reason why i do not give such a high score to this film ... i felt as if at times the story focused too much on the ' proper nouns ' of the sport , so to speak : too much on individual locations at which to surf , and especially too much on individual surfers . i felt as if the documentary had more to do with the nature of the sport , the ideology of the sport , etc . it would have been better ( although this of course was covered , i do not think it got as much time as it warranted ). and for many people who are not absolutely nuts roughly surfing , at times hearing them go on and on about specific locations and specific surfers could become boring . although the video clips and the in - depth research is well - respected , it could have been presented in a way that would be better for those who are not avid surfers . furthermore , my biggest disappointment was at times they spoke of how altogether striking and miraculous certain events in surfing history were yet they did not have the actual footage of these events unfolding , and the whole time you are waiting to see on the silver screen this amazing , breath - taking event that these men are talking roughly as life - changing moments , and in the end all you get is a lot of men talking circa it , and not the actual footage . it was far too tantalizing to myself to hear these stories , and afterwards be unable to see them . i understand the difficulty of obtaining footage of everything , but please : do not brag an event up so much , and then not show it . overall , a very fresh documentary that i enjoyed watching ; not the best documentary due to the above grounds , but being very fresh and having some extremely exciting footage and a good soundtrack , it is a documentary that i would advise everybody to check out .--sport

after the already frustrating " final conflict ", the series hits rock - bottom with this very puny fourth entries . at least the third film tried ( unsuccessfully ) to continue the story of damien , while this one simply rehashes and copies thoughts from the " portent " ( animals are scared of the antichrist , the death of one man is very analogous to the death of the photographer in the first film ). but what looked exciting and creative there looks just dumb here . and the little girls looks simply like a spoiled kid .--kid

i find alan jacobs reviewing very precision concerning the movie ; however i had the opportunity to renting the dvd from blockbuster with a commentary from byu ' s conservator , motion picture archives james d ' arc . the then lds prophet heber j . grant approved of the movie fathom the deviations from historic content for dramatic expression and telescoping events . for example the movie showed joseph smith on trial . despite brigham young ' s great oratory in defense of joseph smith he was convicted anyway . then josef was murdered . historically joseph smith was never convicted of anything . brigham young was in boston when joseph smith was arrested for this particular trial . joseph smith and his brother hyrum where both murdered before the trial took place .--prophet

what can be said , really ... " the tenant " is a first - class thriller wrought with equal amounts of suspense and full - blown paranoia . it ' s an intricately - plotted film -- every detail seems included for a reason -- even though the plot seldom makes sense , and much of it is never even addressed in an targets manner . therefore we are left with the increasingly unsteady trelkovsky ( polanski )-- a meek polish man who has gained an apartment due to the previous tenant ' s suicide -- to guiding us through a world of escalating fear and uncertainty . after an flat - warming party thrown by a group of obnoxious coworkers , trelkovsky comes under increased , seemingly inexplicable scrutiny by the fellow occupiers in his building ; the rest of the film chronicles his mental deterioration and gives us a thorough mindfu * k on par with the later efforts of david lynch .

" the tenant " is a first - class thriller wrought with equal amounts of suspense and full - blown paranoia . it ' s an intricately - plotted film -- every detail seems included for a reasons -- even although the plot seldom makes sense , and much of it is never even addressed in an objective manner . therefore we are left with the increasingly unstable trelkovsky ( polanski )-- a meek polish man who has obtained an apartment due to the previous tenant ' s suicide -- to guide us through a world of escalating fear and uncertainty . after an flat - warming party thrown by a group of obnoxious coworkers , trelkovsky comes under grew , seemingly inexplicable scrutiny by the fellow occupants in his building ; the rest of the film chronicles his mental deterioration and gives us a exhaustive mindfu * k on par with the later efforts of david lynch . " the renters ," however , is more brooding and sinister , laced with unplanned comical relief , fine performances , and a truly haunting score . it ' s a movie that ' s better experienced than described , so hops to it .--fellow

bored with the ordinary , run - of - the - mill staple films to watch this halloween that i ' ve seen over and over again , i took a chance on " the sentinel ", hoping it could get my horror juices flowing again . mind you , i had just come back from seeing the dark castle remake of " the dwelling on haunted hill " - complete and utter crap . mercifully , " the sentinel " blew me away ! in a riviting story about a model who moves into a creepy building in brooklyn hights , the film offered everything that i hope to unearth in a good movie - ( 1 ) campy and fantasically juicy characters , exchanging and dialogue , including hilaraious turns by christopher walken , jeff goldblum and especially , martin balsam , as an absent minded professor - ( 2 ) horrible terror ! not to give a frame away , but there are scenes in this film that chilled me to my pancreas - ( 3 ) terrific gore , terrific make - up and wacky ( if very uneven ) direction from michael winner , which flows rather nicely with this unreal treat . if you loved " evil dead 2 ", " dead alive " and " deep rising " - this will be your queen of favourites . just to emphasize my love for this film - after i watched it for the first time , jaw - dropped , i rewound it and watched it again . it is now one of favourites of all time . do yourself a favour and verifying it out !--jeff

adapting plays into cinema is often a bad ideas because they ' re two different mediums . do you think it ' s a great brainchild to make zulu into a stage play ? imagine it where two valiant redcoats sit in a tent gasping " blimey there ' s thousand of them out there " great movie and a bad phase play in order for a stage play to make great cinema there ' s two essentials needed 1 ) a fine cast that creates on screen chemistry 2 ) great dialogue on paper cher and chazz palminterri would be a good casting choices but not in these roles . the story revolves around a hit - man played by palminterri breaking into a house to kill a wife played by cher with most of the action taking placing inside the house . i was unable to take these two characters seriously though perhaps it was the fault of the script which can ' t decide whether it was trying to be serious or funny . since the tales is very static it ' s of the utmost importance that the dialogue shines and once again because of the weird tone of the screenplay it embarrasses more than anything else with much of the conversation revolving around sex acts . if you want to see a great translation of a stage play transferred to the silver screen give faithful a mademoiselle and watch 12 angry men instead--zulu

ok the plot is , wait you got me there is no true noticeable plot here righteous a string of optically fogged sex scenes , strung together by scenes of photographers taking images of pretty ladies ( sometimes a combination of the two ) subsequently a demon comes around kills the male , rapes and kills the women , and waxes poetic about the meaning of life . asinine special effects , mala acting and weird philosophy aside , you get what you expect from a film with a title like this . i guess it would have to be anybody ' s cup of tea , just not mine as i have yet to see a good kazuo ' gaira ' komizu directed film . dvd extras : subtitled interview with director kazuo komizu part 1 ( part 2 is on the entrails of a marvelous women dvd ); and theatrical tailermy grade : f--demon

although i am inclined to agree with the other remarks made by people who have seen this movie , i am ashamed to say i rather like it . not often can such a huge pile of 80s pap be discovered outside of a wham ! video , so it is most definitely worth a viewing (£ 0 . 79 a night in my local shops !). watch out for the insanely obvious seams and zip on the monster ' s costume , the fact that the ' hero ' looks a lot like keith chegwin and such classic lines as the following : evil wizard - type bloke : " at last we meet kor ..." kor : " thrilling , isn ' t it ?" striking ! ! i furthermore like the fact that although the video box looks quite exciting with images of a castle surrounded by raging seas and a dangerous falcon - like bird carrying a handsome hero to safety ( among other such ' interesting and engaging ' suggestions of what goes on in the actual film , none of them actually happen . no , i ' m not joking ... there really isn ' t a raging sea or a ferocious bird , it ' s just trying to make you interested ... classic in my opinion . this film gets 10 for sheer entertainment value ! !--bloke
this is one of pretty a few cartoons with bugs bunny and marvin the martian - and a space dog called k - 9 is included as well . this looney tunes episode is very funny , has reasonably good cartoon animation ( marvin ' s animation is very well done ) and the plot is well done . the end is rather weird , so be readies for it , it is slightly boring . in this episode , marvin the martian ha been dispatched to terrestrial to capture an earth creature and bring it back to mar . with his trusty dog k - 9 , marvin sets out and soon finds the tracks of no other rabbits but bugs bunny ! he greets them with treats , thinking they are gimmick or treaters in their costumes . little does he realise they are preparing themselves to take this rabbit to mars ... i recommend this episode to somebody who likes bugs bunny , marvin the martian and looney tunes in general . as far as the beginning and the middle of the episode are concerned , you are apt to like this . enjoy " hasty hare "! :-)--creature

i don ' t know whether to recommends this movie to the fans of " tetsuo " or not . why " tetsuo " ? because you can easily label some things circa this movie as a very obvious " tetsuo " rip - off . the concept is similar , editing is equally frantic and fast - which is good because , aside from making the movie more dynamic , it obscures some flaws sparked by low budget and other factors . there is lot more gore , less eroticism and , in the case of " meatball machine " , the transformation of human being into a creature that ' s partially a machine ( sounds familiar ? ) called " necroborg " ( very original ) is caused by slimy little aliens . these slimy little scums from outer space actually use human beings as vessels for their gladiator games that they play with each other . they infest the body , somehow manage to put an insane amount of mechanical parts in it pulling them seemingly out of nowhere and turn it into a killing machine that targets other necroborgs . their targets is to defeat another alien who is in another necroborg , rip it out of the corpse and eaten it . all in all , the plot sounds somewhat silly and i didn ' t expect much , but at the end i actually enjoyed this film . as i said before , this is a low budget flick , but it ' s still comparatively decent . don ' t expect much from actors , they ' re mostly not very good , but it can be condoned . i liked the ambiance and gore , certain bizarre situations and the way the movie is directed and edited . although the story is not too original , it possesses certain charm - to me at least . 7 out of 10 .--human

i recently watched this , but when it starts i had no idea what the concept was roughly , what the topic was ..... in short - i had no idea what it was . was it a documentary , was it a comedy routine ..... well , it was both . it started a little slow , but i think that ' s because i ha absolutely no idea what type of program i was visualizing . but it quickly sucked me in . the episode i watched ha robert wuhl discussing fact and fiction in history . basically how we ( american ' s ) learn history that isn ' t really veritable - and how we got to learn what we did . he did this in such a way as to keep the viewer abundantly entertained , and interested . i actually learned a few things and that is a true indicator of how effective this type of program can be . i would love to see this picked up as a series for hbo . i believe it can be just as fun and effective with a variety of themes - especially if they are " taught " in the identical type of manner as this episode .--american

wow ! i just was given this film from a friend of mined , who purchased it for 1 . 98 at walmart , and he felt that he got taken ! it is beyond boring , most of the scenes are filmed in front of a green screen , the acting is somewhat improvised , almost as if they didn ' t have a script . the martians are cgi , which look like they were done by a novice , or a fan produced movie . i cannot stress just how bad this dvd really is ! instances : in one of the scenes , the martians are torturing a local female captive . she goes from a woman in front of a green screen , to a cgi copy of that woman . the modification is wholly noticeable , and when she is slain , you can behold that it is a computer figure , looking like something from a game back in 1990 ! if at all possible , avoid this movie like the plague ! you can download two trailers from their site , and see how god - awful it really is !--woman

okay , this film probably deserves 7 out of 10 stars , but i ' ve voted for " 10 " to help offset the misleading rating from the handful of bozo ' s who gave this film null or 1 star reviewed . each of the segments for this anthology shows great potential and promise for the talented filmmakers ... three of whom have gone on to achieve notable success in big - time hollywood productions . performances ranging from rough all the way up to utterly striking , with notable turns by bill paxton , james karen , vivian schilling and brion james . martin kove may be a grands melodramatic as the psychotic hypnotist with the bizarro strobe - lamp , and lance august seems intentionally dimwitted as an unsuspecting lab victim . but generals , it ' s got some great laughs and some really scary moments . definitely worth seeing , so judge for yourself !--karen

this is a better than average silent movie and it ' s still well worth seeing if you are a fan of the silents . however , if you aren ' t yet a fan of the genre , i suggest you try a few other films before watching this one . that ' s because the plot just seems pretty old fashioned and difficult to believe in spots . but , despite this , it ' s still a good film and preserved my interest . a nice lady unfortunately hooked up with the wrong man and ran away to marry him . the film launches five years later after she has come to realize that he is really a brutal robber . despite this , she tries to make the best of it and not dwell on how good life had been before this jerk came into her life . however , the rent is due and there ' s no money , so the lady is forced to look for working . she becomes a personal seamstress for a rich lady whose husband is trying to swing a business deal . unfortunately , the lady who they were trying to hook up a potential clients with for a dinner party can ' t make it and the seamstress is paid handsomely to be the man ' s date . well , like cinderella , she cleans up pretty well and the man is infatuated with her ! what to do now -- given that she is actually married and the new dude wants to marry her ?! well , see the movie yourself to see how it ' s all resolved . i didn ' t like how they handles the husband , as it seemed horribly predictable and clichéd . however , once he was out of the way , i do admire how the film also didn ' t give up a by - the - numbers finale and left the film with a few loose ends . all in all , a very good film worth seeing , but certainly not great .--fan

in all the remarks praises or damning dalton ' s performance , i idea he was resplendent . he does not play rochester as a spoiled pretty wealthy boy , but as a roguish , potent man . i liked this version , albeit the shot on video facet was sometimes distracting , and the scenes with jane and st . john never quite gelled . i give this an 8 .--jane
where do i start ? per the title of this film i expected some degree of authenticity , in the end i was severally let down . this is not the story of lale andersen or the song lili marlene , rather it is a hollywood ( or pick your film making hub ) story loosely based on some real life characters . i should have had a clue when i heard a heavy english accent giving the intro to the movie in german ; the blood red texts ( title , entertainers ) ought have been the 2nd clue . the tales line is contrived ( lale was not tricked out of switzerland rolf liebermann ' s parents , there is nos info that liebermann helped smuggle jews from germany , the original song had been recorded outside of the control of the ns regime not while under control , the record played at the station was picked up in vienna while a lt . was there on leave , etc , etc ) the costumes are poor and awry for the time frames ( ss black uniforms used every where from border guards to staff stances , these went away from daily use once the war commence , etc ), the characters are stereo types ( sa bullies in a club once they were essentially out of power ). don ' t wastes your time .--heavy

as i watch this film , it is interesting to see how much it marginalizes black males . the film spends its time showing how powerless the most visible black man in it is ( rescuing for an heroic moment ). for much of the film , the other black men ( and dark - skinned black women ) in the film are way in the background , barely noticeable . vanessa williams ' character was strong and sympathetic . the viewer can readily identify and sympathize with her . there are also some fairly observable and three - dimensional assists characters who are light - skinned , and some white characters of some warmth and dignity . but 99 % of the black males in this film are nothing but invisible men . voiceless shadows in the background , of no consequence . such a horrible flaw , but anything but unusual in the mainstream media .--black

what happened ? what we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast , but somewhere the movie loses it . actually , it never really got going . there was a little excitement when we find out that angie is not really pregnant , then find out that she is after all , but that was it . steve martin , who is a very talented person and ordinarily brings a lot to a movie , was terrifying and his totality nature was not even close to being momentous to this movie , other than to make it longer . i really would have liked to see more interactions between the main personages , kate and angie , and perhaps try not for a pure comedy , which regretfully it was not , but maybe a dramas with comedic elements . i think if the movie did this it could have been very funny since both actresses are quite funny in their own ways and sitting here i can think of numerous scenarios that would have been a riot .--longer
this stories based on two edgar allen poe pieces (" the fall of the house of usher ", " dance of death " ( poem ) ) is actually quite creepy from beginning to end . it is similar to some of the old black - and - white filmmaking roughly people that meet in an old dilapidated housing ( for example , " the cat and the canary ", " the old dark house ", " night of terror " and so on ). boris karloff plays a maniac inventor of life - size dolls that terrorize the guests . he dies early in the film ( or does he ? ) and the dwellers of the house are subjected to a number of awful experiences . i won ' t go into too much detail here , but it is surely a gotta - see for fans of old dark house mysteries . watch it with plenty of popcorn and soda in a darkened room . dan basinger 8 / 10--fans

if you look at corey huge ' s info here on imdb , apparently there ' s a movie called " reload " in production ( as of june ' 08 ) in which he ' s playing a character named sebastian cole . first of all , how does such a crappy movie ever earn a sequel ... and second , didn ' t sebastian get assassinate at the end of " loaded "? i watched this in the wee hours of the morning when i was battle insomnia , and so i was drift in and out while it was on . i ' m sure i missed some plot points , but overall , it seemed truly puny . big ' s performance was ( for me ) one of the stronger parts of the film . i ' m also a bit dumbfounded at all the people commenting on the marvelous girls , since i thought the actress playing brooke was pretty , but not exceptional .--actress

the season finale forwarded blending messages , i felt feelings of joy , and also feelings of being lied to and cheated . roseanne tells all her viewers that the entire season nine was a lie because her husband , dan , had dies . she furthermore admits the families never won the lottery , and what season 9 was a lie righteous being how she wished orr wanted it to be . i ' m still confused about when she said becky ended up with david , and darlene with mark because becky and mark admit to being pregnant . so i believe that is just how she wanted it to be , but it wasn ' t . so the season finale was good , but forwarded mixed feelings . i will always be a fan of the displays . :)--fan

if solely all animation was this great . this film is classic because it is strong is two uncomplicated aspects : story and character . the characters in this film are marvelously personified . i felt for all of the traits , and human - animal relationship in the movie collaborated perfectly . the gorgeous animation and 3 - d computer animation hasn ' t worked better in any other film . this is a great movie for enfant , and for adults who wants a classical hero ' s journey . 8 of 10 .--human

take your basic frankenstein flick , inject some reanimator ( but not the good parts ), and you have doctor hackenstein . indubitably , this was manifestly inspired by aforementioned films but it never materializes as anything special on its own . a scientist accidently kills his wife , so the entire movie takes place over the course of one night as he attempts to reviving his wife . to revive his wife , he decides to cutting off body parts from some women that have become stranded and , coincidentally , deciding to stay the night at his place . i can ' t really say the acting is mala , nor is the directing . everything here is just way too standard . what small attempts there are at humor actually work ( check out the scene when hackenstein keeps hiding behind his deaf assistant because she would undoubtedly be very upset if she saw him clutching a woman and a needle ), but that ' s hardly enough to recommend this film . the music is decent , what blood that ' s there is dignified , and the cast looks quite good . and for half of the time , i was even entertained by this film . but i never felt like this was somethings more than a time waster . preventable . try frankenhooker instead .--deaf

this film sat on my tivo for weeks before i watched it . i dreaded a self - indulgent yuppie flick about relationships gone bad . i was wrong ; this was an engrossing excursion into the screwed - up libidos of new yorkers . the format is the same as max ophuls ' " la ronde ," based on a play by arthur schnitzler , who is given an " inspired by " credit . it starts from one person , a prostitute , standing on a street corner in brooklyn . she is picked up by a home contractor , who has sex with her on the hood of a car , but can ' t come . he reject to pay her . when he ' s off peeing , she answers his cell phone and takes a message . she runs away with his keys . then the story switches to the contractor , who pays a professional call on a rich , bored new york woman , who plays with him until he is aroused , then she pulls away . she tells him how desperate and unhappy she is ; he tells her how beautiful she is , and lucky . as he is leaving , she asks if he would have sex with her . she sits on top of him , bounces up and down . this time he comes , the he leaves . the woman and her husband throw a dinner party for their trendy friends . hubby ( robert ) is talking business , wife ( ellen ) is bored , and switches the subject to sex , and how often men and women think about it . hubby switches talk to desert . later , after the guests leave , ellen attempt to entice robert into sex . robert wants none of it , and puts on a jazz record . ellen turns on the radio ; robert turns up the music ; ellen turns on the tvs ; robert turns on another tv . cacophony ensues . ellen goes up on the roof , robert joins her . ellen confesses that she needs to experience more men , men other than robert . robert says that he too needs to experience men . we next follow robert as he visits an artist , martin , played by steve buscemi . i wish buscemi could have more roles like this , where he is a sexy , smart , totally desirable guy . robert praises martin ' s work , much more than it deserves , promises to get it into a show . martin is excited , until it turns out that robert is speaking out of his groin , it is all a mating dances . robert tries to kiss martin , on the lips , and martin pulls back , saying that he is not gay . robert asserts that he ' s not gay either , martin scoffs . both admit that the artworks are bad . robert is about to leave , when martin allows robert to kiss him . they make out , and robert goes down on martin . next we follow martin , as he prepares for an art show at a manhattan gallery . he is smitten by the receptionist , anna , played by rosario dawson . ( i had to cut some of this review to keep it under 1000 words ) ... and they make love to each other . we next follow anna , who is sitting at a lunch stand . her boyfriend , nick ( adrian grenier ), enters , bearing flowers . she is cold toward him ; he tries to figure out why . he coaxes out of her the information that she has had sex with someone while he was in san francisco . she coaxes out of him the fact that he has stayed with his ex - gf while in san francisco , and had sex with her . the latter revelation turns out to be a lie . the two of them make out in the luncheonette , but she decides that they must break up . nick is heartbroken . and we follow nick , who concedes his troubles to an older woman who he meets on a park bench , joey ( carol kane ). joey is sort of weird and child - like , but is a good audience for nick , who needs a sympathetic ear . the two of them go to coney island at night , and look at the stars . nick falls under joey ' s spell , despite the age difference between them . they go back to joey ' s apartment , and nick gradually realizes that he is about to have sex with a lunatic old woman . she is on top of him , doesn ' t want to let him go . but he manages to escape . ( this is , by the way , the best carol kane role since she played latke ' s wife in taxi .) joey ' s phone rings , and it is a man calling the psychic friends network , and joey is one of the psychic friends . although she is still hurting from nick , she gradually gets into her psychic shtick . the man is at his office , late at night , and wanna to have telephone sex with her . although that is not joey ' s business , joey goes along , and coaxes the man to come . she wants to keep talking , although the man want to get off the phone , and finds out that he has embezzled a lot of money from his company , and will be found out tomorrow . his life is ruined . joey realizes that the man is going to commit suicide , and she tries to make him believe that she is his friend , that she cares about him . and she does care about him . but the man packs a gun into his briefcase , and goes off to seek a prostitute on the brooklyn waterfront , and we come back to the beginning , to the same prostitute who started out la ronde . she wants to give him $ 75 , 000 in cash if she will kill him . he tried to kill himself , but couldn ' t do it . the prostitute does not want to do it , but he insists , holding her hand , holding the gun inside his mouth , telling her where to aim . eventually , the gun goes off , and we see the prostitute walking down the street , and arriving at the corner where she normally does business . the contractor who didn ' t pay her earlier in the movie drives up , rolls down the window . they look at each other . the end .--nick

typically i would have given this movie a 6 . it tackles a very important subjects and it does it relatively well - notwithstanding katie wright which is an accomplishment in and of itself . i have no idea if she was actually instructed to play the character like this or is naturally irksome , but she did an awesome job at making it impossible for me to care for lexi . there ' s no dimension to her other than how confused , helpless and clueless she is , and how good she is at whimpering . i can understand how a young girl who blames herself for the loss of her friends and whose eating disorder has spiraled out of control would be distraught , scared and in pain . however , wright ' s entire performance is based on unceasing wailing and sniveling , the remainder being whining . i couldn ' t helped but feel this particular girl ' s problem was caused not by the demon that is bulimia , but by her not having a spine . i very much doubt that ' s the point the movie meant to make .--demon
diagnosis murders has been shown on most weekday afternoons on bbc1 since i used to watch it while ill from school a good 10 years ago - i know i shouldn ' t really enjoy it , in the same way i shouldn ' t enjoy ' murder she wrote ' but i ' m altogether addicted to both and even have the dvd box - sets .... ok i know that ' s sad ! dick van dyke carries the show as he stars as dr . mark sloan a doctor at community general hospital in l . a who is also a police consultant for the l . a . p . d . - his son steve ( barry van levee - dick ' s real life son ) is a policeman officer , who needs his father ' s help on very many suspicious deaths . along for the ride is dr . amanda bentley ( victoria bentley ) the resident pathologist at community general and for the first couple of seasons you had scott baio playing dr . jack stewart , who upped and left the series in 1995 hoping to go on to bigger and better things ... he should have stayed where he was , he hasn ' t done anything of note since .... and his only theatrical appearance for many years was in baby geniuses 2 : superbabies .... oh dear !! ! anyhow dr . jack stewart was replaced by the younger dr . jesse travis played by charlie schlatter who stepped into baio ' s shoes pretty comfortably . the series is hugely implausible but what whodunit series isn ' t ? ( murder she wrote - everywhere jessica goes , someone ends up dead , or the underestimated father dowling mysteries about a murder solving priest with nun sidekick ) the series was much lighter up until 1997 this is because it had a supporting cast that included the bumbling hospital manager norman briggs played by michael tucci along with nurse & mark ' s secretary delores played by delores hall , after 1997 both these characters were no longer included and the series became a grittier affair with a bigger looking budget , some episodes included far more action , one episode the entire hospital is blown up . this was a family show for the van dyke ' s because as well as dick ' s son barry , you also had dick ' s daughter and all his grandchildren making an appearance in various episodes . as the serial went on it got a bit silly , one episode i remember dick van dike plays his entire family , which was a bit out of the habitual , but on the totality ' diagnosis murder ' was a really good tv show which had numerous good guest stars . since this show finished in 2001 , dick & barry have appeared together again in the ' murder 101 ' series of tv movies made by the hallmark channel , pretty much following the same path , and still enjoyable . dick who ' s now in his mid 80 ' s doesn ' t seem to change a great deal , and looks as if he ' ll be working till the bitter end . tv show **** out of *****--community

i saw this movie in my international cinema class and was grossed out from get go . this movie is nothing but one scene of flagrant shock value after the next . the 4th man is about an alcoholic writer named reve , who has visions of his in - pending danger . he meets up with a woman named christine when giving a lecture at a local book club , and only decides to stay with her when he discovers how attractive her boyfriend is . to put it plainer , reve likes the dutch sausage . so reve concocts a plan to seduce christine ' s boyfriend so he can ultimately have sexuality with him . but its later uncovered that christine has had 3 previous husbands , who she all murdered . now reve and christine ' s boyfriend could be " the 4th man ." the storyline makes sense with no plot holes . the edit and everything else that is technical about this movie is perfectly fine . the movie is just gross and i felt the needs to vomit in some parts . predominantly , this isn ' t my cup of tea . the movie opened with reve getting out of bed in just a t - shirt . so in the very beginning , you get to see reve ' s lovely pecker flopping around as he walks around his cramped apartment in a hangover state . later on he has a dream where his pecker gets cut off by a pair of scissors , and they do show it along with the blood fountain that ensues . reve fondles a statue of jesus and has homosexual sex in a mausoleum . plus there ' s a lot of blood . more blood than all the freddie krueger movies combined . not that i have anything against " shocking " scenes , but this movie is just so overt when it comes to shocking . the whole movie is revolved around the shock value . so if any of this is your cup of tea , watch this movie . otherwise , stay far far far far far away from this one . my mind is still scarred .--jesus

( congratulations !)--watcher
now days , most people don ' t watch classic movies , such as this . most of buddies exclusively watch movies from the ' 90s to present . thats kinda stingy . most old movies like this are masterpieces , sole in their owned way . only because , back when these films were being thought of and made , thats when ideas were fresh . now people strain just to think of new ideas . anyhow , to the movie . for veritable fans of classic horror . this is for you . the movie is based with a investigator from scotland yard investigating the disappearance of an movie actor , and stumbles on to three other bizarre occurrences with past inhabitants of the same house . i won ' t said anymore , for i will ruin the movie more than i already have . but it is a terrific movie for as old as it is . and would never mind watching it again !--fans

" zorro ' s fighting legion " is , as witness the comments here , one of the greatest of serials . it is fascinating and generally very well made . reed hadley was a fine actor , and , as someone else commented , he made a very good fop . but , admittedly , it is the action that makes this movie so great . and what else could we expect , with direction by that excellent team , witney and english , with great music from the amazingly prolific william lava ( the listing here says he was uncredited , but that is incorrect ; those other composers listed here were indeed uncredited , and i don ' t know if they did write any of the music -- it sounds like lava ), and with villainy from , among others , the great charles king , and with dozens of bite parts ? also noteworthy was a villain played by the radio tarzan , jim pierce , who was edgar rice burroughs ' son - in - law .

for people interested in business and the corporate world , this show is simply the best of the best . as one of the former contestants of the show wrote in his blog around this innovative show : people in business finally had an audience . the whole idea is perfect ; having a group of businesspeople competing against each other in business - related tasks , set in the best place in the world , new york city . donald trump is perfect as the boss , even though his ego is bigger than the whole universe times infinity . he also makes a lot of questionable decisions about whom to fire , which is one of the negatives about the show . season 1 : great season generals , the best season of the " normal " ones . this season was the one that was most about actual business skills . later on the series almost drowned in marketing related tasks with way too many product placements . great and interesting contestants overall , with the most likable character ever in this series : troy . i know i ' m not the only person who suspect that the trump world tower - episode where he got fired was rigged to have amy and nick win this particular task . season 2 : also a great season . the tasks were still quite much ok , and it had many interesting contestants . jen m was terrible and should never had made it to the final , imo . also , this season had the worst firing ever ( pamela ). season 3 : terrible . actually , i liked the concept of book smarts vs . street smarts , but the cast was so utterly terrible ( it turned out that trump hated the cast as well ) that the whole season was a total disaster . best moments was the seconds episode ( motel renovation ), with pm brian fired , a guy who added nothing but overwhelming amounts of comedy value . season 4 : an excellent season , much because of the interesting and entertaining contestants this season ( especially randall , alla , marcus and the total disaster whose name was toral ). the " take me out to the boardroom " episode is one of the absolute classics of this exhibition , ending with the well - remembered quadruple firing . sadly , i think we got robbed for the randall vs . alla final . i think trump was afraid that she could have won , and prevented that from happening . season 5 : a boring season with really no special things to it . brent was just an embarrassment and obviously only there to create drama . the tasks were terrible overall ( how has creating a jingle anything to do with business at all ?). i guess the best man won , but personally i couldn ' t care less . season 6 : i can see why they wanted to try out l . a . as a new location for the show , but looking back it was a mistake . new york will always be the place for this . this season added so many new things , most of them terrible ( like losing team having to sleep outside in tents , winning pm continues to be pm , for example ). the tasks were terrible and trump also chose the wrong winner . james deserved it , no doubt . season 7 : celebrity edition . best season ever . totally different rules ( like the use of rolodexes ), but all fun and entertainment . the biggest problem was that many of the contestants were not real celebrities at all , especially the women where everyone were unknown to me except for omarosa , who is a total disgrace to everything she takes part in . this looked to be gene simmon ' s season , but after he made a complete fool of himself during the kodak task , another man emerged from the shadows : pier morgan . never has anyone dominated a season like he did . he crushed his opponents and also came across as a guy with a great sense of humor ( although some uptight americans ( not all americans , of course , don ' t take me wrong ) sadly didn ' t have the social proficiency to understand it ). way to go piers ! ! for fans of this i highly recommend the uk version starring sir alan sugar as the boss . in fact , the british version is manner better , and that says something since the american ( and original ) truly is a great show . one thing about the uk version is that the contestants normally tend to behave like decent human beings in the boardroom , unlike the constants yelling and rude behavior that takes place in the us version .--celebrity
with fast intercutting of scenes of crazed people in an asylum , and montage / superimposition of photo , and vague , interwoven narratives , this is a very hard movie to follow . apparently a man ( masue inoue ) takes a job as a porter orr janitor in an asylum so he can be near his imprisoned wife , and maybe to rescue her . but she ' s clearly mad , huddled on the floor , with a vacant expression much of the time and fear , misery , and confusion written on her face the rest of the time . the film - maker switches to her point of visualizing sometimes , and we see unclear images of her at the side of a pond drown a baby , or clutching at a sunk child . she ' s tormented by something . when the point of view shifts to her or other mad folks , the filmmaker usage distorting lenses and such things , showing us what mad people see and then how they react . and the place is swarming with mad folks , laughing , hiding , and in one case dancing frenetically night and day . at one point the man tries to take his wife outside , but the night outside the gate terrifies her and she runs back to her cell . gradually the man slips into a nightmare in which he ' s interrupted in another endeavour to steal her away , and he kills the doctor and many attendants , and all the while the crazed folk laugh and applaud . when he wakes he is relieved , and mops the floor . some enthralling shots of japanes life , streets , buildings in the 1920s .--porter
i happen to be the director ' s nephew . it ' s taken me years to get my hands on a copy of this film and i can confirm that it is indeed one of the lousiest movies of all time . my uncle doesn ' t even have a copy of it anymore ( i asked ). i ' m looking forward to bringing him a copied . presently the film ' s average rating is 1 . 9 / 10 . as far as i can told , that should put it someplace in the mid - 30s in the imdb " bottom 100 ," nevertheless with exclusively 206 voting , it hasn ' t yet placed . it ' s sad that the film doesn ' t even get the respect of a bottom 100 title . anyhow , i ' m giving copies of the movie to family members this year for holiday gifts . best / lousiest gift ever ?--director

" the wide variety of american types prefigures the comedies of preston sturges , though for manufacturing celebrity , " grand slam " most calls to mind two better movies from the same ( pre - codes ) era with lee tracy playing quick - talkingpublicists : " the half - naked truth " and " bombshell ," but " grand slam " has itsmoments , especially for anyone who has played bridge with serious pointcounters . loretta young was already a clothes horse .

as far as parody filmmaking go , there are few that are worth time and energy . but with a recent resurgence of horrid parodies such as date movie and the comebacks , it is a respiration of fresh air to come back and rediscover a truly funny parody like johnnie precariously . after his mother has no end of medical problem , little johnny goes to work for the mob . what fallows is a series of gags , most of which work , there are , however , the occasional flops . but a foreign gangster who can ' t master the american linguistic ( profanity wise , at least ), a competitor gangster with a penchant for shooting his mouth off (... once ! ), a younger brother with the d . a . who is out to get johhny dangerously , and a hot young starlet hot for his affections have johnnie busy . and the viewer will be busy laugh , for the most part , as every gangster - movie cliché is skewered by a talented cast and decent writing . not perfect by a long shot , but definitely good for a smile on a bad day .--master

mahatma has been depicted as a man who neglected his own son in this movie . don ' t get me incorrect i am not condemning the movie ; it is such a beautiful movie and walked out of the cinema with a lump in my throat . we need to fathom mahatma ' s spiritual standing , he is a genuine spiritual leader . only a fully enlightened man could possibly detach himself from his adore ones . a man with such caliber leads his families and followers by example . according to the movie , he spoke to his son and tries to make him understand where he is coming from , but poor harilall with so small intellect could not understand his father . when things went amiss with harilall , mahatma could remain calm and accepted that his son is a large tragedy . had it been any other parents , they would have jeopardised their values to assist the son to get on his feet . mahatma couldn ' t do that , he is true leader who leads by example .--leader
